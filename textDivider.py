Каждый урок пособия, наряду с введением лексического мате-
риала в виде текстов, содержит терминологический тезаурус, кото-
рый позволяет выявить и логически упорядочить термины каждого
урока в их связи с другими разделами и понятиями. Тезаурус, или
тематический словарь, устанавливает предметные и логические
связи базовых, основных, производных и прочих терминов, заме-
няя контекст и естественным образом откладываясь в памяти уча-
щихся. Способ отбора лексического материала в пособии является
методическим, что позволяет более эффективно усваивать профес-
сиональную англоязычную лексику за счет парадигматических
контекстных связей терминов, что весьма актуально в условиях
ограниченных временных возможностей для изучения английского
языка в техническом вузе. В каждом уроке содержатся вопросы к
тексту, ответы на которые предусматривают активное использова-
ние изучаемой терминологии.
Для формирования лексических навыков в каждом уроке содер-
жится три вида упражнений. Упражнение 1 предлагает составить
термины из предлагаемого набора букв и направлено на развитие
продуктивных лексических навыков. В упражнении 2 требуется
составить правильные словосочетания из отдельных слов, что
направлено на узнавание фразеологических единиц, являющихся
самостоятельными терминами. В упражнении 3 предлагается вы-
брать термин среди перечисленных и вставить его в текст. Упраж-
нение направлено на формирование знаний семантики термина и
распознавание его значения по контексту.
В приложении пособия помещен терминологический словарь,
состоящий как из отдельных слов, так и из словосочетаний (со-
ставляющих более 80% терминов физики). Слова, входящие в сло-
восочетание, могут отсутствовать в терминологическом словаре
приложения в виде отдельных понятий, так как предполагается
формирование потенциального словаря учащегося в процессе обу-
чения. При этом некоторые термины могут присутствовать неодно-
кратно, так как их перевод зависит от контекста. Типичным приме-
ром является понятие «momentum», являющееся основополагаю-
щим в физике, правильный перевод которого зависит от области
применения.
7

UNIT 1
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 1, answer
the questions after the texts
The goal of physics is to provide an understanding of the physical
world by developing theories based on experiments. A physical theory is
essentially a guess, usually expressed mathematically, about how a given
physical system works. The theory makes certain predictions about the
physical system which can then be checked by observations and experiments.
If the predictions turn out to correspond closely to what is actually
observed, then the theory stands, although it remains provisional. No theory
to date has given a complete description of all physical phenomena,
even within a given subdiscipline of physics. Every theory is a work in
progress.
The basic laws of physics involve such physical quantities as force, velocity,
volume, and acceleration, all of which can be described in terms of
more fundamental quantities. In mechanics, the three most fundamental
quantities are length (L), mass (M), and time (T); all other physical quantities
can be constructed from these three.
Standards of Length, Mass and Time
To communicate the result of a measurement of a certain physical
quantity, a unit for the quantity must be defined. For example, if our fundamental
unit of length is defined to be 1.0 meter, and someone familiar
with our system of measurement reports that a wall is 2.0 meters high, we
know that the height of the wall is twice the fundamental unit of length.
Likewise, if our fundamental unit of mass is defined as 1.0 kilogram, and
we are told that a person has a mass of 75 kilograms, then that person has a
mass 75 times as great as the fundamental unit of mass.
In 1960, an international committee agreed on a standard system of
units for the fundamental quantities of science, called SI (System International).
Its units of length, mass, and time are the meter, kilogram, and second,
respectively.
9
Length
In 1799, the legal standard of length in France became the meter, defined
as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North
Pole. Until 1960, the office length of the meter was the distance between
two lines on a specific bar of platinum iridium alloy stored under controlled
conditions. This standard was abandoned for several reasons, the
principal one being that measurements of the separation between the lines
are not precise enough. In 1960, the meter was denned as 1650763.73
wavelengths of orange-red light emitted from a krypton-86 lamp. In October
1983, this definition was abandoned also, and the meter was redefined
as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of
1/299792458 second. This latest definition establishes the speed of light at
299792458 meters per second.
Mass
The SI unit of mass, the kilogram, is defined as the mass of a specific
platinum-iridium alloy cylinder kept at the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures at Sevres, France. Mass is a quantity used to measure
the resistance to a change in the motion of an object. It's more difficult
to cause a change in the motion of an object with a large mass than an object
with a small mass.
Time
Before 1960, the time standard was defined in terms of the average
length of a solar day in the year 1900. (A solar day is the time between
successive appearances of the Sun at the highest point it reaches in the sky
each day.) The basic unit of time, the second, was denned to be
(1/60)*(1/60)*(1/24) = 1/86400 of the average solar day. In 1967, the second
was redefined to take advantage of the high precision attainable with
an atomic clock, which uses the characteristic frequency of the light emitted
from the cesium-133 atom as its "reference clock". The second is now
defined as 9192631700 times the period of oscillation of radiation from the
cesium atom.
Coordinate systems
One convenient and commonly used coordinate system is the Cartesian
coordinate system, sometimes called the rectangular coordinate system. An
arbitrary point in this system is labeled with the coordinates (x, y). Positive
x is usually selected as right of the origin and positive y upward from the
origin, but in two dimensions this choice is largely a matter of taste.

Sometimes it's more convenient to locate a point in space by its plane
polar coordinates (r, £). A point is then specified by the distance r from the
origin to the point and by the angle £ between the reference line and a line
drawn from the origin to the point. The standard reference line is usually
selected to be the positive x-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system. The
angle £ is considered positive when measured counterclockwise from the
reference line and negative when measured clockwise.
Trigonometry
The basic trigonometric functions defined by such a triangle are the ratios
of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. These relationships are called
the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Another important relationship,
called the Pythagorean theorem, exists between the lengths of the sides of
a right triangle.

UNIT 2
MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 2, answer
the questions after the texts
Life is motion. Our muscles coordinate motion microscopically to enable
us to walk and jog. Our hearts pump tirelessly for decades, moving
blood through our bodies. Cell wall mechanisms move select atoms and
molecules in and out of cells. From the prehistoric chase of antelopes
across the savanna to the pursuit of satellites in space, mastery of motion
has been critical to our survival and success as a species.
The study of motion and of physical concepts such as force and mass is
called dynamics. The part of dynamics that describes motion without regard
to its causes is called kinematics. In this Unit, the focus is on kinematics
in one dimension: motion along a straight line. This kind of motion -
and, indeed, any motion - involves the concepts of displacement, velocity,
and acceleration. Here, we use these concepts to study the motion of objects
undergoing constant acceleration.
The first recorded evidence of the study of mechanics can be traced to
the people of ancient Sumeria and Egypt, who were interested primarily in
understanding the motions of heavenly bodies. The most systematic and
detailed early studies of the heavens were conducted by the Greeks from
about 300 b.c. to a.d. 300. Ancient scientists and laypeople regarded the
Earth as the center of the Universe. This geocentric model was accepted by
13
such notables as Aristotle (384-322 b.c.) and Claudius Ptolemy (about a.d.
140). Largely because of the authority of Aristotle, the geocentric model
became the accepted theory of the Universe until the 17th century.
About 250 b.c, the Greek philosopher Aristarchus worked out the details
of a model of the Solar System based on a spherical Earth that rotated
on its axis and revolved around the Sun. He proposed that the sky appeared
to turn westward because the Earth was turning eastward. This model wasn't
given much consideration, because it was believed that if the Earth
turned, it would set up a great wind as it moved through the air. We know
now that the Earth carries the air and everything else with it as it rotates.
The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) is credited
with initiating the revolution that finally replaced the geocentric model. In
his system, called the heliocentric model, Earth and the other planets revolve
in circular orbits around the Sun.
This early knowledge formed the foundation for the work of Galileo
Galilei (1564-1642), who stands out as the dominant facilitator of the entrance
of physics into the modern era. In 1609, he became one of the first
to make astronomical observations with a telescope. He observed mountains
on the Moon, the larger satellites of Jupiter, spots on the Sun, and the
phases of Venus. Galileo's observations convinced him of the correctness
of the Copernican theory. His quantitative study of motion formed the
foundation of Newton's revolutionary work in the next century.
Displacement
Motion involves the displacement of an object from one place in space
and time to another. Describing the motion requires some convenient coordinate
system and a specified origin. A frame of reference is a choice of
coordinate axes that defines the starting point for measuring any quantity,
an essential first step in solving virtually any problem in mechanics.
Because displacement has both a magnitude (size) and a direction, it's a
vector quantity, as are velocity and acceleration. In general, a vector quantity
is characterized by having both a magnitude and a direction. By contrast,
a scalar quantity has magnitude, but no direction. Scalar quantities
such as mass and temperature are completely specified by a numeric value
with appropriate units; no direction is involved.
Velocity
In day-to-day usage, the terms speed and velocity are interchangeable.
In physics, however, there's a clear distinction between them: Speed is a
14
scalar quantity, having only magnitude, while velocity is a vector, having
both magnitude and direction.
Why must velocity be a vector? If you want to get to a town 70 km
away in an hour's time, it's not enough to drive at a speed of 70 km/h; you
must travel in the correct direction as well. This is obvious, but shows that
velocity gives considerably more information than speed, as will be made
more precise in the formal definitions.
The average speed of an object over a given time interval is defined as
the total distance traveled divided by the total time elapsed.
Acceleration
Going from place to place in your car, you rarely travel long distances
at constant velocity. The velocity of the car increases when you step harder
on the gas pedal and decreases when you apply the brakes. The velocity
also changes when you round a curve, altering your direction of motion.
The changing of an object's velocity with time is called acceleration. The
average acceleration during the time interval is the change in velocity divided
by time (meter per second per second, m/s2).
Acceleration is a vector quantity having dimensions of length divided
by the time squared. For the case of motion in a straight line, the direction
of the velocity of an object and the direction of its acceleration are related
as follows: When the object's velocity and acceleration are in the same
direction, the speed of the object increases with time. When the object's
velocity and acceleration are in opposite directions, the speed of the object
decreases with time. The minus signs indicate that the velocities of the car
are in the negative direction; they do not mean that the car is slowing
down! Positive and negative accelerations specify directions relative to
chosen axes, not "speeding up" or "slowing down." The terms "speeding
up" or "slowing down" refer to an increase and a decrease in speed, respectively.
The value of the average acceleration often differs in different time intervals,
so it's useful to define the instantaneous acceleration. The instantaneous
acceleration is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval.

Negative acceleration doesn't necessarily mean an object is slowing
down. If the acceleration is negative and the velocity is also negative, the
object is speeding up. The word deceleration means a reduction in speed, a
slowing down. Some confuse it with a negative acceleration, which can
speed something up.
Velocity and acceleration are sometimes confused with each other, but
they're very different concepts, as can be illustrated with the help of motion
diagrams. If the car moves the same distance in each time interval, this
means that the car moves with constant positive velocity and has zero acceleration.
Freely falling objects
According to legend, Galileo discovered the law of falling objects by
observing that two different weights dropped simultaneously from the
Leaning Tower of Pisa hit the ground at approximately the same time. Although
it's unlikely that this particular experiment was carried out, we
know that Galileo performed many systematic experiments with objects
moving on inclined planes. In his experiments, he rolled balls down a
slight incline and measured the distances they covered in successive time
intervals. The purpose of the incline was to reduce the acceleration and
enable Galileo to make accurate measurements of the intervals. Galileo's
achievements in the science of mechanics paved the way for Newton in his
development of the laws of motion.

UNIT 3
VECTORS AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL MOTION
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 3, answer
the questions after the texts
In discussion of one-dimensional we used the concept of vectors only
to limited extent. In our further study of motion, manipulating vector quantities
will become increasingly important, so much of this Unit is devoted
to vector techniques. We’ll then apply these mathematical tools to twodimensional
motion, especially that of projectiles, and to the understanding
of relative motion.
Vectors and their properties
Each of physical quantities can be categorized as either a vector quantity
or a scalar quantity. Vector has both direction and magnitude (size). A
scalar can be completely specified by its magnitude with appropriate units;
it has no direction. Displacement, velocity, and acceleration are vector
quantities. Temperature is an example of a scalar quantity. If the temperature
of an objects is -5°C, that information completely specifies the temperature
of the object; no direction is required. Masses, time intervals, and
volumes are scalars as well. Scalar quantities can be manipulated with the
rules of ordinary arithmetic. Vector can also be added and subtracted from
each other, and multiplied, but there are a number of important differences.
Equality of Two Vectors. Two vectors are equal if they have the same
magnitude and the same direction. This property allows us to translate a
vector parallel to itself in a diagram without affecting the vector. In fact,
for most purposes, any vector can be moved parallel to itself without being
affected.
Adding Vectors. When two or more vectors are added, they must all
have the same units. For example, it doesn't make sense to add a velocity
vector, carrying units of meters per second, to a displacement vector, carrying
units of meters. Scalars obey the same rule: It would be similarly
meaningless to add temperatures to volumes or masses to time intervals.
Vectors can be added geometrically or algebraically. The resultant vector
R = A + В is the vector drawn from the tail of A to the tip of B. This
procedure is known as the triangle method of addition. When two vectors
are added, their sum is independent of the order of the addition:
A + В = В + A. This relationship is called the commutative law of addition.
19
Negative of a Vector. The negative of the vector A is defined as the
vector that gives zero when added to A. This means that A and -A have the
same magnitude but opposite directions.
Displacement, velocity, and acceleration in two dimensions
In one-dimensional motion the direction of a vector quantity such as a
velocity or acceleration can be taken into account by specifying whether
the quantity is positive or negative. The velocity of a rocket, for example,
is positive if the rocket is going up and negative if it's going down. This
simple solution is no longer available in two or three dimensions. Instead,
we must make full use of the vector concept.
Motion in two dimensions
Anyone who has tossed any kind of object into the air has observed
projectile motion. If the effects of air resistance and the rotation are neglected,
the path of a projectile in Earth's gravity field is curved in the
shape of a parabola. The most important experimental fact about projectile
motion in two dimensions is that the horizontal and vertical motions are
completely independent of each other. This means that motion in one direction
has no effect on motion in the other direction.
In general, the equations of constant acceleration developed in Unit 2
follow separately for both the x-direction and the y-direction. An important
difference is that the initial velocity now has two components. We assume
that at t = 0, the projectile leaves the origin with an initial velocity. If the
velocity vector makes an angle Q with the horizontal, Q is called the projection
angle.
For example:
A water fountain. The individual water streams follow parabolic trajectories.
The horizontal range and maximum height of a given stream of water
depend on the elevation angle of that stream's initial velocity as well as
its initial speed.
Acceleration at the Highest Point
The acceleration in the y-direction is not zero at the top of a projectile's
trajectory. Only the y-component of the velocity is zero there. If the acceleration
were zero, too, the projectile would never come down!
Relative velocity
Relative velocity is all about relating the measurements of two different
observers one moving with respect to the other. The measured

velocity of an object depends on the velocity of the observer with respect to
the object. On highways, for example, cars moving in the same direction
are often moving at high speed relative to Earth, but relative each other they
hardly move at all. To an observer at rest at the side of the road, a car might
be traveling at 60 mi/h, but to an observer in a truck traveling in the same
direction at 50 mi/h, the car would appear to be traveling only 10 mi/h.
So measurements of velocity depend on the reference frame of the observer.
Reference frames are just coordinate systems. Most of the time, we
use a stationary frame of reference relative to Earth, but occasionally we
use a moving frame of reference associated with a bus, car, or plane moving
with constant velocity relative to Earth.

THE LAWS OF MOTION
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 4, answer
the questions after the texts
Classical mechanics describes the relationship between the motion of
objects found in our everyday world and the forces acting on them. As
long as the system under study doesn't involve objects comparable in size
to an atom or traveling close to the speed of light, classical mechanics provides
an excellent description of nature.
Newton's three laws of motion are simple and sensible. The first law
states that a force must be applied to an object in order to change its velocity.
Changing an object's velocity means accelerating it, which implies a
relationship between force and acceleration. This relationship, the second
law, states that the net force on an object equals the object's mass times its
acceleration. Finally, the third law says that whenever we push on something,
it pushes back with equal force in the opposite direction. These are
the three laws in a nutshell.
Newton's three laws, together with his invention of calculus are used
routinely today in virtually all areas of mathematics, science, engineering,
and technology. Newton's theory of universal gravitation had a similar impact,
starting a revolution in celestial mechanics and astronomy that continues
to this day. With the advent of this theory, the orbits of all the plan23
ets could be calculated to high precision and the tides understood. The theory
even led to the prediction of "dark stars," now called black holes, over
two centuries before any evidence for their existence was observed.
Forces
A force is commonly imagined as a push or a pull on some object, perhaps
rapidly, as when we hit a tennis ball with a racket. We can hit the ball
at different speeds and direct it into different parts of the opponent's court.
This means that we can control the magnitude of the applied force and also
its direction, so force is a vector quantity, just like velocity and acceleration.
Another class of forces doesn't involve any direct physical contact. Early
scientists, including Newton, were uneasy with the concept of forces
that act between two disconnected objects. Nonetheless, Newton used this
'action-at-a-distance' concept in his law of gravity, whereby a mass at one
location, such as the Sun, affects the motion of a distant object such as
Earth despite no evident physical connection between the two objects. To
overcome the conceptual difficulty associated with action at a distance,
Michael Faraday (1791-1867) introduced the concept of a field. The corresponding
forces are called field forces.
The known fundamental forces in nature are all field forces: the strong
nuclear force between subatomic particles; the electromagnetic forces between
electric charges; the weak nuclear force, which arises in certain radioactive
decay processes; and the gravitational force between objects.
Newton’s first law
Before about 1600, scientists felt that the natural state of matter was the
state of rest. Galileo, however, devised thought experiments - such as an
object moving on a frictionless surface, as just described - and concluded
that it's not the nature of an object to stop, once set in motion, but rather to
continue in its original state of motion. This approach was later formalized
as Newton's first law of motion: An object moves with a velocity that is
constant in magnitude and direction, unless acted on by a nonzero net
force. The net force on an object is defined as the vector sum of all external
forces exerted on the object. External forces come from the object's
environment. If an object's velocity isn't changing in either magnitude or
direction, then its acceleration and the net force acting on it must both be
zero.
24
Mass and Inertia
Imagine hitting a golf ball off a tee with a driver. If you're a good golfer,
the ball will sail over two hundred yards down the fairway. Now imagine
teeing up a bowling ball and striking it with the same club. Your club
would probably break, you might sprain your wrist, and the bowling ball,
at best, would fall off the tee, take half a roll and come to rest.
From this thought experiment, we conclude that while both balls resist
changes in their state of motion, the bowling ball offers much more effective
resistance. The tendency of an object to continue in its original state of
motion is called inertia. While inertia is the tendency of an object to continue
its motion in the absence of a force, mass is a measure of the object's
resistance to changes in its motion due to a force.
Newton’s second law
Newton's second law answers the question of what happens to an object
that does have a net force acting on it. Imagine pushing a block of ice
across a frictionless horizontal surface. When you exert some horizontal
force on the block, it moves with an acceleration of, 2 m/s2. If you apply a
force twice as large, the acceleration doubles to 4 m/s2. Pushing three times
as hard triples the acceleration, and so on. From such observations, we
conclude that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional the net
force acting on it. Mass also affects acceleration. The acceleration of an
object is inversely proportional to its mass. This approach was later formalized
as Newton's second law of motion: The acceleration of an object
is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional
to its mass.
The Gravitational Force
The gravitational force is the mutual force of attraction between any
two objects in the Universe. Although the gravitational force can be very
strong between very large objects, it's the weakest of the fundamental
forces. In addition to contributing to the understanding of motion, Newton
studied gravity extensively. Newton's law of universal gravitation states
that every particle in the Universe attracts every other particle with a force
that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. If
the particles have masses m1 and m2 and are separated by a distance r, the
magnitude of the gravitational force, F is G* m1* m2/ r 2, where G is the
universal gravitation constant.

The magnitude of the gravitational force acting on an object of mass
m near Earth's surface is called the weight, w, of the object, given by
w = mg, where g is the acceleration of gravity. SI unit: newton (N). Unlike
mass, weight is not an inherent property of an object because it can take
different values, depending on the value of g in a given location.
Newton’s third law
According to Newton, as the nail is driven into the block by the force
exerted by the hammer, the hammer is slowed down and stopped by the
force exerted by the nail. Newton described such paired forces with his
third law: If object 1 and object 2 interact, the force F12 exerted by object
1 on object 2 is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force
F21 exerted by object 2 on object 1.
Newton's third law constantly affects our activities in everyday life.
Without it, no locomotion of any kind would be possible, whether on foot,
on a bicycle, or in a motorized vehicle.
Applications of Newton’s laws
When we apply Newton's law to an object, we are interested only in
those forces which act on the object. The most important step in solving a
problem by means of Newton's second law is to draw the correct free-body
diagram. Include only those forces that act directly on the object of interest.
A zero net force on a particle does not mean that the particle isn't moving.
It means that the particle isn't accelerating. If the particle has a nonzero
initial velocity and is acted upon by a zero net force, it continues to
move with the same velocity.
Forces of friction
An object moving on a surface or through a viscous medium, such as
air or water, encounters resistance as it interacts with its surroundings. This
resistance is called friction. Forces of friction are essential in our everyday
lives. Even standing in one spot would be impossible without friction, as
the slightest shift would instantly cause you to slip and fall. The force that
counteracts F and keeps is called the force of static friction. We call the
friction force for an object in motion the force of kinetic friction. Friction
makes it possible to grip and hold things, drive a car, walk, and run.

UNIT 5
ENERGY
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 5, answer
the questions after the texts
Energy is one of the most important concepts in the world of science.
In everyday use, energy is associated with the fuel needed for transportation
and heating, with electricity for lights and appliances, and with the
foods we consume. These associations, however, don't tell us what energy
is, only what it does, and that producing it requires fuel.
Energy is present in the Universe in a variety of forms, including mechanical,
chemical, electromagnetic, and nuclear energy. Even the inert
mass of everyday matter contains a very large amount of energy. Although
energy can be transformed from one kind to another, all observations and
experiments to date suggest that the total amount of energy in the Universe
never changes. This is also true for an isolated system - a collection of objects
that can exchange energy with each other, but not with the rest of the
Universe. If one form of energy in an isolated system decreases, then another
form of energy in the system must increase. For example, if the system
consists of a motor connected to a battery, the battery converts chemical
energy to electrical energy, and the motor converts electrical energy to
mechanical energy. Understanding how energy changes from one form to
another is essential in all the sciences.
Using an energy approach to solve certain problems is often much easier
than using forces and Newton's three laws. These two very different
approaches are linked through the concept of work.
Work
Work has a different meaning in physics than it does in everyday usage.
In the physics definition, a programmer does very little work typing away
at a computer. In physics, work is done only if an object is moved through
some displacement while a force is applied to it. It's easy to see the difference
between the physics definition and the everyday definition of work.
The programmer exerts very little force on the keys of a keyboard, creating
only small displacements, so relatively little physics work is done. The
mason must exert much larger forces on the concrete blocks and move
them significant distances, and so performs a much greater amount of
work. Even very tiring tasks, however, may not constitute work according
29
to the physics definition. A truck driver, for example, may drive for several
hours, but if he doesn't exert a force, and he doesn't do any work.
Kinetic energy
Solving problems using Newton's second law can be difficult if the
forces involved are complicated. An alternative is to relate the speed of an
object to the net work done on it by external forces. If the net work can be
calculated for a given displacement, the change in the object's speed is
easy to evaluate. We can think of kinetic energy as the work a moving object
can do in coming to rest. For example, suppose a hammer is on the
verge of striking a nail. The moving hammer has kinetic energy and can
therefore do work on the nail.
Gravitational Potential energy
An object with kinetic energy (energy of motion) can do work on another
object, just like a moving hammer can drive a nail into a wall. A
brick on a high shelf can also do work. It can fall off the shelf, accelerate
downwards, and hit a nail squarely, driving it into the floorboards. The
brick is said to have potential energy associated with it, because from its
location on the shelf it can potentially do work. Potential energy is a property
of a system, rather than of a single object, because it's due to a physical
position in space relative a center of force.
Gravitational Work and Potential Energy
For most trajectories - say, for a ball traversing a parabolic arc - finding
the gravitational work done on the ball requires sophisticated techniques
from calculus. Fortunately, for conservative fields there's a simple alternative:
potential energy. Gravity is a conservative force, and for every conservative
force a special expression called a potential energy function can
be found.
Spring Potential energy
Springs are important elements in modern technology. They are found
in machines of all kinds, in watches, toys, cars, and trains. Work done by
an applied force in stretching or compressing a spring can be recovered by
removing the applied force, so like gravity, the spring force is conservative.
Pushing a block against the spring compresses it a distance x. While x
appears to be merely a coordinate, for springs it also represents a displacement
from the equilibrium position. Fs = - k x , where k is a constant
of proportionality, the spring constant, carrying units of newtons per meter
and called Hooke's law.

The energy either leaves the system and goes into the surrounding environment,
or it stays in the system and is converted into a. nonmechanical
form such as thermal energy. A simple example is a block sliding along a
rough surface. Friction creates thermal energy, absorbed partly by the
block and partly by the surrounding environment. When the block warms
up, something called internal energy increases. The internal energy of a
system is related to its temperature, which in turn is a consequence of the
activity of its parts, such as the moving atoms of a gas or the vibration of
atoms in a solid. Energy can be transferred between a nonisolated system
and its environment.
Power
The rate at which energy is transferred is important in the design and
use of practical devices, such as electrical appliances and engines of all
kinds. The issue is particularly interesting for living creatures, since the
maximum work per second, or power output, of an animal varies greatly
with output duration. Power is denned as the rate of energy transfer with
time. If an external force is applied to an object, and if the work done by
this force in the time interval, then the average power delivered to the object
during this interval is the work done divided by the time interval.
The SI unit of power is the joule/sec, also called the watt, named after
James Watt. The horsepower was first defined by Watt, who needed a
large power unit to rate the power output of his new invention, the steam
engine. In electric power generation, it's customary to use the kilowatthour
as a measure of energy.

UNIT 6
MOMENTUM AND COLLISIONS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 6, answer
the questions after the texts
What happens when two automobiles collide? How does the impact affect
the motion of each vehicle, and what basic physical principles determine
the likelihood of serious injury? How do rockets work, and what
mechanisms can be used to overcome the limitations imposed by exhaust
speed? Why do we have to brace ourselves when firing small projectiles at
high velocity? Finally, how can we use physics to improve our golf game?
To begin answering such questions, we introduce momentum. Intuitively,
anyone or anything that has a lot of momentum is going to be hard
to stop. In politics, the term is metaphorical. Physically, the more momentum
an object has, the more force has to be applied to stop it in a given
time. This concept leads to one of the most powerful principles in physics:
conservation of momentum. Using this law, complex collision problems
can be solved without knowing much about the forces involved during
contact. We'll also be able to derive information about the average force
delivered in an impact. With conservation of momentum, we'll have a better
understanding of what choices to make when designing an automobile
or a moon rocket, or when addressing a golf ball on a tee.
Momentum and impulse
In physics, momentum has a precise definition. A slowly moving brontosaurus
has a lot of momentum, but so does a little hot lead shot from the
muzzle of a gun. We therefore expect that momentum will depend on an
object's mass and velocity. The linear momentum p of an object of mass m
moving with velocity v is the product of its mass and velocity.
Changing the momentum of an object requires the application of a
force. This is, in fact, how Newton originally stated his second law of motion.
Changing an object's momentum requires the continuous application
of a force over a period of time, leading to the definition of impulse. Impulse
is a vector quantity with the same direction as the constant force acting
on the object. The impulse of the force acting on an object equals the
change in momentum of that object.
34
Conservation of momentum
When a collision occurs in an isolated system, the total momentum of
the system doesn't change with the passage of time. Instead, it remains
constant both in magnitude and in direction. The momenta of the individual
objects in the system may change, but the vector sum of all the momenta
will not change. Action and reaction, together with the accompanying exchange
of momentum between two objects, is responsible for the phenomenon
known as recoil.

We can summarize the types of collisions as follows:
In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is
not.
In a perfectly inelastic collision, momentum is conserved, kinetic energy
is not, and the two objects stick together after the collision, so their final
velocities are the same.
Collision
A collision may be the result of physical contact between two objects.
For any type of collision, the total momentum of the system just before the
collision equals the total momentum just after the collision as long as the
system may be considered isolated. An elastic collision is defined as one in
which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The collision of
a rubber ball with a hard surface is inelastic, because some of the kinetic
energy is lost when the ball is deformed during contact with the surface.
Elastic and perfectly inelastic collisions are limiting cases; most actual collisions
fall into a range in between them.
In application, medical professionals use a device called a tonometer to
measure the pressure inside the eye. This device releases a puff of air
against the outer surface of the eye and measures the speed of the air after
reflection from the eye. At normal pressure, the eye is slightly spongy, and
the pulse is reflected at low speed. As the pressure inside the eye increases,
the outer surface becomes more rigid, and the speed of the reflected pulse
increases. In this way, the speed of the reflected puff of air can measure the
internal pressure of the eye.
An important subset of collisions takes place in a plane. The game of
billiards is a familiar example involving multiple glancing collisions of
objects moving on a two-dimensional surface.
Rocket propulsion
When ordinary vehicles such as cars and locomotives move, the driving
force of the motion is friction. In the case of the car, this driving force is
exerted by the road on the car, a reaction to the force exerted by the wheels
against the road. Similarly, a locomotive "pushes" against the tracks;
hence, the driving force is the reaction force exerted by the tracks on the
locomotive.
However, a rocket moving in space has no road or tracks to push
against. In fact, reaction forces also propel a rocket. When the explosion
36
occurs, the gas presses against the chamber in all directions, but can't press
against anything at the hole, where it simply escapes into space.

ROTATIONAL MOTION AND THE LAW OF GRAVITY
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 7, answer
the questions after the texts
Rotational motion is an important part of everyday life. The rotation of
the Earth creates the cycle of day and night, the rotation of wheels enables
easy vehicular motion, and modern technology depends on circular motion
in a variety of contexts, from the tiny gears in a Swiss watch to the operation
of lathes and other machinery. The concepts of angular speed, angular
acceleration, and centripetal acceleration are central to understanding the
motions of a diverse range of phenomena, from a car moving around a
circular race track to clusters of galaxies.
Rotational motion, when combined with Newton's law of universal
gravitation and his laws of motion, can also explain certain facts about
space travel and satellite motion, such as where to place a satellite so it will
remain fixed in position over the same spot on the Earth. The generalization
of gravitational potential energy and energy conservation offers an
easy route to such results as planetary escape speed. Finally, we present
Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, which formed the foundation of
Newton's approach to gravity.
Angular speed and angular acceleration
In the study of linear motion, the important concepts are displacement,
velocity, and acceleration. Each of these concepts has its analog in rotational
motion: angular displacement, angular velocity and angular accel38
eration. The radian, a unit of angular measure, is essential to the understanding
of these concepts. Generally, angular quantities in physics must
be expressed in radians. Be sure to set your calculator to radian mode; neglecting
to do this is a common error.
Rotation motion under constant angular acceleration
A number of parallels exist between the equations for rotational motion
and those for linear motion. The procedure used to develop the kinematic
equations for linear motion under constant acceleration can be used to derive
a similar set of equations for rotational motion under constant angular
acceleration.
Relations between angular and linear quantities
Angular variables are closely related to linear variables. The tangential
speed of a point on a rotating object equals the distance of that point from
the axis of rotation multiplied by the angular speed. Every point on the
rotating object has the same angular speed. The tangential acceleration of a
point on a rotating object equals the distance of that point from the axis of
rotation multiplied by the angular acceleration.
Centripetal acceleration
For circular motion at constant speed, the acceleration vector always
points toward the center of the circle. Such an acceleration is called a centripetal
(center-seeking) acceleration. Geometric result relating the centripetal
acceleration to the angular speed, but physically an acceleration can
occur only if some force is present. For example, if a car travels in a circle
on flat ground, the force of static friction between the tires and the ground
provides the necessary centripetal force.
The acceleration itself is always directed towards the center of rotation.
Because the tangential and centripetal components of acceleration are perpendicular
to each other, we can find the magnitude of the total acceleration
with the Pythagorean theorem.
Fictitious Forces
Anyone who has ridden a merry-go-round as a child (or as a fun-loving
grown-up) has experienced what feels like a "center-fleeing" force. Holding
onto the railing and moving toward the center feels like a walk up a
steep hill.

Actually, this so-called centrifugal force is fictitious. In reality, the rider
is exerting a centripetal force on his body with his hand and arm muscles.
In addition, a smaller centripetal force is exerted by the static friction between
his feet and the platform. If the rider's grip slipped, he wouldn't be
flung radially away; rather, he would go off on a straight line, tangent to
the point in space where he let go of the railing. The rider lands at a point,
that is further away from the center, but not by "fleeing the center" along a
radial line. Instead, he travels perpendicular to a radial line, traversing an
angular displacement while increasing his radial displacement.
Newtonian gravitation
Prior to 1686, a great deal of data had been collected on the motions of
the Moon and planets, but no one had a clear understanding of the forces
affecting them. In that year, Isaac Newton provided the key that unlocked
the secrets of the heavens. He knew from the first law that a net force had
to be acting on the Moon. If it were not, the Moon would move in a
straight-line path rather than in its almost circular orbit around Earth. Newton
reasoned that this force arose as a result of an attractive force between
Moon and Earth, called the force of gravity, and that it was the same kind
of force that attracted objects - such as apples - close to the surface of the
Earth. In 1687, Newton published his work on the law of universal gravitation.
The gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere on a particle outside
the sphere is the same as the force exerted if the entire mass of the
sphere were concentrated at its center. This is called Gauss's law, after the
German mathematician and astronomer Karl Friedrich Gauss. The gravitational
constant was first measured in an important experiment by Henry
Cavendish in 1798.

UNIT 8
ROTATIONAL EQUILIBRIUM
AND ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 8, answer
the questions after the texts
In the study of linear motion, objects were treated as point particles
without structure. It didn't matter where a force was applied, only whether
it was applied or not.
The reality is that the point of application of a force does matter. In
football, for example, if the ball carrier is tackled near his midriff, he might
carry the tackier several yards before falling. If tackled well below the
waistline, however, his center of mass rotates toward the ground, and he
can be brought down immediately. Tennis provides another good example.
A tennis ball is struck with a strong horizontal force acting through its center
of mass, it may travel a long distance before hitting the ground, far out
of bounds. Instead, the same force applied in an upward, glancing stroke
will impart topspin to the ball, which can cause it to land in the opponent's
court.
The concepts of rotational equilibrium and rotational dynamics are also
important in other disciplines. For example, students of architecture benefit
from understanding the forces that act on buildings and biology students
should understand the forces at work in muscles and on bones and joints.
These forces create torques, which tell us how the forces affect an object's
equilibrium and rate of rotation.
Finally, torques applied to an object through a given time interval can
change the object's angular momentum. In the absence of external torques,
angular momentum is conserved, a property that explains some of the mysterious
and formidable properties of pulsars - remnants of supernova explosions
that rotate at equatorial speeds approaching that of light.
Torque
Forces cause accelerations; torques cause angular accelerations. There
is a definite relationship, however, between the two concepts. If a force F
is applied to the door, there are three factors that determine the effectiveness
of the force in opening the door: the magnitude of the force, the position
of application of the force, and the angle at which it is applied.
43
Under these conditions, an object can rotate around the chosen axis in
one of two directions. By convention, counterclockwise is taken to be the
positive direction, clockwise the negative direction. When an applied force
causes an object to rotate counterclockwise, the torque on the object is positive.
When the force causes the object to rotate clockwise, the torque on
the object is negative. If the net torque isn't zero, the object starts rotating
at an ever-increasing rate. If the net torque is zero, the object's rate of rotation
doesn't change.
Torque is a vector perpendicular to the plane determined by the position
and force vectors. The direction can be determined by the right-hand
rule.
An object in mechanical equilibrium must satisfy the following two
conditions:
1. The net external force must be zero.
2. The net external torque must be zero.
The center of gravity
The center of mass and center of gravity of an object are exactly the
same when the free-fall acceleration doesn't vary significantly over the
object.
The center of gravity of a homogeneous, symmetric body must lie on
the axis of symmetry. For example, the center of gravity of a homogeneous
rod lies midway between the ends of the rod, and the center of gravity of a
homogeneous sphere or a homogeneous cube lies at the geometric center
of the object. The center of gravity of an irregularly shaped object, such as
a wrench, can be determined experimentally by suspending the wrench
from two different arbitrary points.
A rigid object in a uniform gravitational field can be balanced by a single
force equal in magnitude to the weight of the object, as long as the
force is directed upward through the object's center of gravity.
Relationship between torque and angular acceleration
When a rigid object is subject to a net torque, it undergoes an angular
acceleration that is directly proportional to the net torque. This result is
analogous to Newton's second law. The torque on the object is proportional
to the angular acceleration of the object, where the constant of proportionality
is called the moment of inertia of the object.

Angular momentum
The net torque acting on an object is equal to the time rate of change of
the object's angular momentum. Recall that this equation also parallels the
impulse-momentum theorem.
The mechanical energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum of
an isolated system all remain constant. If the moment of inertia of an isolated
rotating system changes, the system's angular speed will change.
Note that conservation of angular momentum applies to macroscopic objects
such as planets and people, as well as to atoms and molecules.
There are many examples of conservation of angular momentum; one
of the most dramatic is that of a figure skater spinning in the finale of her
act. Coming out of the spin, she needs to reduce her angular velocity, so
she extends her arms and legs again, increasing her moment of inertia and
thereby slowing her rotation.

UNIT 9
SOLIDS AND FLUIDS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 9, answer
the questions after the texts
There are four known states of matter: solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas.
In the universe at large, plasmas - systems of charged particles interacting
electromagnetically - are the most common. In our environment on
Earth, solids, liquids, and gases predominate.
An understanding of the fundamental properties of these different states
of matter is important in all the sciences, in engineering, and in medicine.
47
Forces put stresses on solids, and stresses can strain, deform, and break
those solids, whether they are steel beams or bones. Fluids under pressure
can perform work, or they can carry nutrients and essential solutes, like the
blood flowing through our arteries and veins. Flowing gases cause pressure
differences that can lift a massive cargo plane or the roof off a house in a
hurricane. High-temperature plasmas created in fusion reactors may someday
allow humankind to harness the energy source of the sun. The study of
any one of these states of matter is itself a vast discipline.
States of matter
Everyday experience tells us that a solid has a definite volume and
shape. A brick, for example, maintains its familiar shape and size day in
and day out. A liquid has a definite volume but no definite shape. A gas
differs from solids and liquids in that it has neither definite volume nor
definite shape. Because gas can flow, however, it shares many properties
with liquids.
All matter consists of some distribution of atoms or molecules. The atoms
in a solid, held together by forces that are mainly electrical, are located
at specific positions with respect to one another and vibrate about those
positions. At low temperatures, the vibrating motion is slight and the atoms
can be considered essentially fixed. As energy is added to the material, the
amplitude of the vibrations increases. A vibrating atom can be viewed as
being bound in its equilibrium position by springs attached to neighboring
atoms. Solids can be classified as either crystalline or amorphous.
For any given substance, the liquid state exists at a higher temperature
than the solid state. The intermolecular forces in a liquid aren't strong
enough to keep the molecules in fixed positions, and they wander through
the liquid in random fashion. Solids and liquids both have the property that
when an attempt is made to compress them, strong repulsive atomic forces
act internally to resist the compression.
In the gaseous state, molecules are in constant random motion and exert
only weak forces on each other. The average distance between the molecules
of a gas is quite large compared with the size of the molecules. Occasionally
the molecules collide with each other, but most of the time they
move as nearly free, noninteracting particles. As a result, unlike solids and
liquids, gases can be easily compressed.
When a gas is heated to high temperature, many of the electrons surrounding
each atom are freed from the nucleus. The resulting system is a
collection of free, electrically charged particles - negatively charged elec48
trons and positively charged ions. Such a highly ionized state of matter
containing equal amounts of positive and negative charges is called a
plasma. A Unlike a neutral gas, the long-range electric and magnetic forces
allow the constituents of a plasma to interact with each other. Plasmas are
found inside stars and in accretion disks around black holes, for example,
and are far more common than the solid, liquid, and gaseous states because
there are far more stars around than any other form of celestial matter, except
possibly dark matter. Dark matter, inferred by observations of the motion
of stars around the galaxy, makes up about 90% of the matter in the
universe and is of unknown composition.
The deformation of solids
While a solid may be thought of as having a definite shape and volume,
it's possible to change its shape and volume by applying external forces. A
sufficiently large force will permanently deform or break an object, but
otherwise, when the external forces are removed, the object tends to return
to its original shape and size. This is called elastic behavior.
The elastic properties of solids are discussed in terms of stress and
strain. Stress is the force per unit area causing a deformation; strain is a
measure of the amount of the deformation. For sufficiently small stresses,
stress is proportional to strain, with the constant of proportionality depending
on the material being deformed and on the nature of the deformation.
We call this proportionality constant the elastic modulus.
We define the tensile stress as the ratio of the magnitude of the external
force to the cross-sectional area. The SI unit of stress is the newton per
square meter (N/m2), called the pascal (Pa). The tensile strain is defined as
the ratio of the change in length to the original length and is therefore a
dimensionless quantity. We can write an equation relating tensile stress to
tensile strain, where the constant of proportionality is Young's modulus.
It's possible to exceed the elastic limit of a substance by applying a sufficiently
great stress. A material subjected to a stress beyond this limit ordinarily
doesn't return to its original length when the external force is removed.
As the stress is increased further, it surpasses the ultimate strength:
the greatest stress the substance can withstand without breaking. The
breaking point for brittle materials is just beyond the ultimate strength.

Another type of deformation occurs when an object is subjected to a
force parallel to one of its faces while the opposite face is held fixed by a
second force. This kind of stress is called a shear stress. There is no change
in volume with this kind of deformation. A material having a large shear
modulus is difficult to bend.
The volume stress is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the change
in the applied force to the surface area. The bulk modulus characterizes the
response of a substance to uniform squeezing. The reciprocal of the bulk
modulus is the compressibility of the material.
Density and pressure
Equal masses of aluminum and gold have an important physical difference:
The aluminum takes up over seven times as much space as the
gold. While the reasons for the difference lie at the atomic and nuclear
levels, a simple measure of this difference is the concept of density.
Fluids don't sustain shearing stresses, so the only stress that a fluid can
exert on a submerged object is one that tends to compress it, which is bulk
stress. The force exerted by the fluid on the object is always perpendicular
to the surfaces of the object. The pressure at a specific point in a fluid can
be measured. As the device is submerged in a fluid, the fluid presses down
on the top of the piston and compresses the spring until the inward force
exerted by the fluid is balanced by the outward force exerted by the spring.
Notice that the force that compresses the spring is spread out over the entire
area, motivating our formal definition of pressure.
Buoyant forces and Archimedes’s principle
A fundamental principle affecting objects submerged in fluids was discovered
by the Greek mathematician and natural philosopher Archimedes.
Archimedes's principle can be stated as follows: Any object completely or
partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force with magnitude
equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Fluids in motion
When a fluid is in motion, its flow can be characterized in one of two
ways. The flow is said to be streamline, or laminar, if every particle that
passes a particular point moves along exactly the same smooth path followed
by previous particles passing that point. This path is called a streamline.
The flow of a fluid becomes irregular, or turbulent, above a certain
velocity or under any conditions that can cause abrupt changes in velocity.
51
Surface tension
If you look closely at a dewdrop sparkling in the morning sunlight, you
will find that the drop is spherical. The drop takes this shape because of a
property of liquid surfaces called surface tension.
Transport phenomena
When a fluid flows through a tube, the basic mechanism that produces
the flow is a difference in pressure across the ends of the tube. This pressure
difference is responsible for the transport of a mass of fluid from one
location to another. The two fundamental processes involved in fluid
transport resulting from concentration differences are called diffusion and
osmosis.

THERMAL PHYSICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 10, answer
the questions after the texts
How can trapped water blow off the top of a volcano in a giant explosion?
What causes a sidewalk or road to fracture and buckle spontaneously
when the temperature changes? How can thermal energy be harnessed to
do work, running the engines that make everything in modern living possible?
Answering these and related questions is the domain of thermal physics,
the study of temperature, heat, and how they affect matter. Quantitative
descriptions of thermal phenomena require careful definitions of the
concepts of temperature, heat, and internal energy. Heat leads to changes
in internal energy and thus to changes in temperature, which cause the expansion
or contraction of matter. Such changes can damage roadways and
buildings, create stress fractures in metal, and render flexible materials stiff
and brittle, the latter resulting in compromised O-rings and the Challenger
disaster. Changes in internal energy can also be harnessed for transportation,
construction, and food preservation.
Gases are critical in the harnessing of thermal energy to do work. Within
normal temperature ranges, a gas acts like a large collection of noninteracting
point particles, called an ideal gas. Such gases can be studied
on either a macroscopic or microscopic scale. On the macroscopic scale,
the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles associated with
a gas can be related in a single equation known as the ideal gas law. On the
microscopic scale, a model called the kinetic theory of gases pictures the
components of a gas as small particles. This model will enable us to understand
how processes on the atomic scale affect macroscopic properties like
pressure, temperature, and internal energy.
Temperature and the Zeroth law of thermodynamics
Temperature is commonly associated with how hot or cold an object
feels when we touch it. While our senses provide us with qualitative indi54
cations of temperature, they are unreliable and often misleading. A metal
ice tray feels colder to the hand, for example, than a package of frozen
vegetables at the same temperature, due to the fact metals conduct thermal
energy more rapidly than a cardboard package. What we need is a reliable
and reproducible method of making quantitative measurements that establish
the relative "hotness" or "coldness" of objects - a method related solely
to temperature. Scientists have developed a variety of thermometers for
making such measurements.
When placed in contact with each other, two objects at different initial
temperatures will eventually reach a common intermediate temperature.
If a cup of hot coffee is cooled with an ice cube, for example, the
ice rises in temperature and eventually melts while the temperature of
the coffee decreases. Understanding the concept of temperature requires
understanding thermal contact and thermal equilibrium. The exchange
of energy between two objects because of differences in their temperatures
is called heat.
We can summarize these results in a statement known as the zeroth
law of thermodynamics (the law of equilibrium): If objects A and В are
separately in thermal equilibrium with a third object C, then A and В are
in thermal equilibrium with each other.
Thermometers and temperature scales
Thermometers are devices used to measure the temperature of an object
or a system. When a thermometer is in thermal contact with a system,
energy is exchanged until the thermometer and the system are in
thermal equilibrium with each other. For accurate readings, the thermometer
must be much smaller than the system, so that the energy the
thermometer gains or loses doesn't significantly alter the energy content
of the system. All thermometers make use of some physical property
that changes with temperature and can be calibrated to make the temperature
measurable.
One common thermometer in everyday use consists of a mass of liquid
- usually mercury or alcohol - that expands into a glass capillary
tube when its temperature rises. In this case the physical property that
changes is the volume of a liquid. To serve as an effective thermometer,
the change in volume of the liquid with change in temperature must be
very nearly constant over the temperature ranges of interest. When the
cross-sectional area of the capillary tube is constant as well, the change
in volume of the liquid varies linearly with its length along the tube. The
55
most common temperature scale in use in the United States is the Fahrenheit
scale.
The Constant-Volume Gas Thermometer and the Kelvin Scale
We can construct practical thermometers such as the mercury thermometer,
but these types of thermometers don't define temperature in a
fundamental way. One thermometer, however, is more fundamental, and
offers a way to define temperature and relate it directly to internal energy:
the gas thermometer. In a gas thermometer, the temperature readings
are nearly independent of the substance used in the thermometer. The
behavior observed in this device is the variation of pressure with temperature
of a fixed volume of gas.
Absolute zero is used as the basis for the Kelvin temperature scale.
The second point is the triple point of water, which is the single temperature
and pressure at which water, water vapor, and ice can coexist in
equilibrium.
Thermal expansion of solids and liquids
The discussion of the liquid thermometer made use of one of the
best-known changes that occur in most substances: As temperature of
the substance increases, its volume increases. This phenomenon, known
as thermal expansion, plays an important role in numerous applications.
Thermal expansion joints, for example, must be included in buildings,
concrete highways, and bridges to compensate for changes in dimensions
with variations in temperature.
The overall thermal expansion of an object is a consequence of the
change in the average separation between its constituent atoms or molecules.
To understand this idea, consider how the atoms in a solid substance
behave.
Macroscopic description of an ideal gas
The properties of gases are important in a number of thermodynamic
processes. Our weather is a good example of the types of processes that
depend on the behavior of gases. If we introduce a gas into a container,
it expands to fill the container uniformly, with its pressure depending on
the size of the container, the temperature, and the amount of gas.

ENERGY IN THERMAL PROCESSES
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 11, answer
the questions after the texts
When two objects with different temperatures are placed in thermal
contact, the temperature of the warmer object decreases while the temperature
of the cooler object increases. With time, they reach a common equilibrium
temperature somewhere in between their initial temperatures. During
this process, we say that energy is transferred from the warmer object
to the cooler one.
Until about 1850, the subjects of thermodynamics and mechanics were
considered two distinct branches of science, and the principle of conservation
of energy seemed to describe only certain kinds of mechanical systems.
Experiments performed by the English physicist James Joule (1818-
1889) and others showed that the decrease in mechanical energy (kinetic
plus potential) of an isolated system was equal to the increase in internal
energy of the system. Today, internal energy is treated as a form of energy
that can be transformed into mechanical energy and vice versa. Once the
59
concept of energy was broadened to include internal energy, the law of
conservation of energy emerged as a universal law of nature.
Heat and internal energy
A major distinction must be made between internal energy and heat.
These terms are not interchangeable - heat involves a transfer of internal
energy from one location to another. The following formal definitions
will make the distinction precise.
Internal energy is the energy associated with the microscopic components
of a system - the atoms and molecules of the system. The internal
energy includes kinetic and potential energy associated with the random
translational, rotational, and vibrational motion of the particles that
make up the system, and any potential energy bonding the particles together.
Heat is the transfer of energy between a system and its environment
due to a temperature difference between them.
Early in the development of thermodynamics, before scientists realized
the connection between thermodynamics and mechanics, heat was
defined in terms of the temperature changes it produced in an object,
and a separate unit of energy, the calorie, was used for heat.
Specific heat
The historical definition of the calorie is the amount of energy necessary
to raise the temperature of one gram of a specific substance - water -
by one degree. The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of
one kilogram of an arbitrary substance by 1° varies with the substance.
Every substance requires a unique amount of energy per unit mass to
change the temperature of that substance by 1.0°C.
High specific heat is responsible for the moderate temperatures found
in regions near large bodies of water. As the temperature of a body of water
decreases during winter, the water transfers energy to the air, which
carries the energy landward when prevailing winds are toward the land.
Off the western coast of the United States, the energy liberated by the Pacific
Ocean is carried to the east, keeping coastal areas much warmer than
they would otherwise be. Winters are generally colder in the eastern
coastal states, because the prevailing winds tend to carry the energy away
from land.

During the day, the Sun adds roughly equal amounts of energy to the
beach and the water, but the lower specific heat of sand causes the beach to
reach a higher temperature than the water. As a result, the air above the
land reaches a higher temperature than the air above the water. The denser
cold air pushes the less dense hot air upward (due to Archimedes's principle),
resulting in a breeze from ocean to land during the day.
Calorimetry
One technique for measuring the specific heat of a solid or liquid is
to raise the temperature of the substance to some value, place it into a
vessel containing cold water of known mass and temperature, and
measure the temperature of the combination after equilibrium is
reached. Define the system as the substance and the water. If the vessel
is assumed to be a good insulator, so that energy doesn't leave the system,
then we can assume the system is isolated. Vessels having this
property are called calorimeters, and analysis performed using such vessels
is called calorimetry.
The principle of conservation of energy for this isolated system requires
that the net result of all energy transfers is zero. If one part of the
system loses energy, another part has to gain the energy, because the
system is isolated and the energy has nowhere else to go. When a warm
object is placed in the cooler water of a calorimeter, the warm object
becomes cooler while the water becomes warmer.
Latent heat and phase change
A substance usually undergoes a change in temperature when energy is
transferred between the substance and its environment. In some cases,
however, the transfer of energy doesn't result in a change in temperature.
This can occur when the physical characteristics of the substance change
from one form to another, commonly referred to as a phase change. Some
common phase changes are solid to liquid (melting), liquid to gas (boiling),
and a change in the crystalline structure of a solid. Any such phase
change involves a change in the internal energy, but no change in the temperature.
Latent heat of the substance, depends on the nature of the phase
change. The unit of latent heat is the joule per kilogram (J/kg). The latent
heat of fusion is used when a phase change occurs during melting or freezing,
while the latent heat of vaporization is used when a phase change oc62
curs during boiling or condensing. When a gas cools, it eventually returns
to the liquid phase, or condenses. The energy per unit mass given up during
the process is called the heat of condensation, and it equals the heat of
vaporization. When a liquid cools, it eventually solidifies, and the heat of
solidification equals the heat of fusion.
Global warming and greenhouse gases
Many of the principles of energy transfer, and opposition to it, can be
understood by studying the operation of a glass greenhouse. During the
day, sunlight passes into the greenhouse and is absorbed by the walls,
soil, plants, and so on. This absorbed visible light is subsequently reradiated
as infrared radiation, causing the temperature of the interior to
rise.
In addition, convection currents are inhibited in a greenhouse. As a
result, warmed air can't rapidly pass over the surfaces of the greenhouse
that are exposed to the outside air and thereby cause an energy loss by
conduction through those surfaces.
A phenomenon commonly known as the greenhouse effect can also
play a major role in determining the Earth's temperature. First, note that
the Earth's atmosphere is a good transmitter (and hence a poor absorber)
of visible radiation and a good absorber of infrared radiation. The visible
light that reaches the Earth's surface is absorbed and reradiated as
infrared light, which in turn is absorbed (trapped) by the Earth's atmosphere.
An extreme case is the warmest planet, Venus, which has a carbon
dioxide (CO2) atmosphere and temperatures approaching 850°F.

UNIT 12
THE LAWS OF THERMODINAMICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 12, answer
the questions after the texts
According to the first law of thermodynamics, the internal energy of
a system can be increased either by adding energy to the system or by
doing work on it. This means the internal energy of a system, which is
just the sum of the molecular kinetic and potential energies, can change
as a result of two separate types of energy transfer across the boundary
of the system. Although the first law imposes conservation of energy for
both energy added by heat and work done on a system, it doesn't predict
which of several possible energy-conserving processes actually occur in
nature.
The second law of thermodynamics constrains the first law by establishing
which processes allowed by the first law actually occur. For example,
the second law tells us that energy never flows by heat spontaneously
from a cold object to a hot object. One important application this
law is in the study of heat engines (such as the internal combustion engine)
and the principles that limit their efficiency.
Work in thermodynamic processes
Energy can be transferred to a system by heat and by work done on
the system. In most cases of interest treated here, the system is a volume
of gas, which is important in understanding engines. All such systems of
gas will be assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, so that every
part of the gas is at the same temperature and pressure. If that were not
the case, the ideal gas law wouldn't apply and most of the results presented
here wouldn't be valid.
The first law of thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics is another energy conservation law
that relates changes in internal energy - the energy associated with the
position and jiggling of all the molecules of a system - to energy transfers
due to heat and work. The first law is universally valid, applicable
to all kinds of processes, providing a connection between the microscopic
and macroscopic worlds.
There are two ways energy can be transferred between a system and
its surroundings: by doing work, which requires a macroscopic dis65
placement of an object through the application of a force; and by heat,
which occurs through random molecular collisions. Both mechanisms
result in a change in internal energy, of the system and therefore in
measurable changes in the macroscopic variables of the system, such as
the pressure, temperature, and volume. The energy transferred to the
system is positive when energy is transferred into the system by heat
and negative when energy is transferred out of the system by heat.
A gas with a larger molar specific heat requires more energy to realize
a given temperature change. The size of the molar specific heat depends
on the structure of the gas molecule and how many different ways
it can store energy. A monatomic gas such as helium can store energy as
motion in three different directions. A gas such as hydrogen, on the other
hand, is diatomic in normal temperature ranges, and aside from moving
in three directions, it can also tumble, rotating in two different directions.
So hydrogen molecules can store energy in the form of translational
motion, and in addition can store energy through tumbling. Molecules
can also store energy in the vibrations of their constituent atoms.
A gas composed of molecules with more ways to store energy will have
a larger molar specific heat.
There are four basic types of thermal processes. In an isobaric process
the pressure remains constant as the gas expands or is compressed.
Expanding volume and decreasing temperature means the pressure must
also decrease, in conformity with the ideal gas law. In the adiabatic process,
no energy enters or leaves the system by heat. Such a system is
insulated - thermally isolated from its environment. An adiabatic expansion
is of practical importance and is nearly realized in an internal combustion
engine. An isovolumetric process, sometimes called an isochoric
process, proceeds at constant volume. In an isochoric process, the
change in internal energy of a system equals the energy transferred to
the system by heat. During an isothermal process the temperature of a
system doesn't change. If the system is an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal
process, the work done on the system is equal to the negative of
the thermal energy transferred to the system.
Heat engines and the second law of thermodynamics
A heat engine takes in energy by heat and partially converts it to other
forms, such as electrical and mechanical energy. In a typical process
for producing electricity in a power plant, for instance, coal or some
other fuel is burned, and the resulting internal energy is used to convert
66
water to steam. The steam is then directed at the blades of a turbine, setting
it rotating. Finally, the mechanical energy associated with this rotation
is used to drive an electric generator. In another heat engine - the
internal combustion engine in an automobile - energy enters the engine
as fuel is injected into the cylinder and combusted, and a fraction of this
energy is converted to mechanical energy.
In general, a heat engine carries some working substance through a
cyclic process during which (1) energy is transferred by heat from a
source at a high temperature, (2) work is done by the engine, and (3)
energy is expelled by the engine by heat to a source at lower temperature.
As an example, consider the operation of a steam engine in which
the working substance is water. The water in the engine is carried
through a cycle in which it first evaporates into steam in a boiler and
then expands against a piston. After the steam is condensed with cooling
water, it returns to the boiler, and the process is repeated.
The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the work done by
the engine, divided by the energy absorbed during one cycle. We can think
of thermal efficiency as the ratio of the benefit received (work) to the cost
incurred. Heat engines can operate in reverse. The work is done in the
compressor unit of the refrigerator, compressing a refrigerant such as freon,
causing its temperature to increase. A household air conditioner is another
example of a heat pump. Some homes are both heated and cooled by
heat pumps.
There are limits to the efficiency of heat engines. The ideal engine
would convert all input energy into useful work, but it turns out that
such an engine is impossible to construct. The Kelvin-Planck formulation
of the second law of thermodynamics can be stated as follows: No
heat engine operating in a cycle can absorb energy from a reservoir and
use it entirely for the performance of an equal amount of work.
To summarize, the first law says we can't get a greater amount of energy
out of a cyclic process than we put in, and the second law says we
can't break even. No engine can operate with 100% efficiency, but different
designs yield different efficiencies, and it turns out one design in
particular delivers the maximum possible efficiency. This design is the
Carnot cycle. Understanding it requires the concepts of reversible and
irreversible processes. In a reversible process, every state along the path
is an equilibrium state, so the system can return to its initial conditions
67
by going along the same path in the reverse direction. A process that
doesn't satisfy this requirement is irreversible.

The Carnot Engine
In 1824, in an effort to understand the efficiency of real engines, a
French engineer named Sadi Carnot (1796-1832) described a theoretical
engine now called a Carnot engine that is of great importance from both
a practical and a theoretical viewpoint. He showed that a heat engine
operating in an ideal, reversible cycle-now called a Carnot cycle - between
two energy reservoirs is the most efficient engine possible. Such
an engine establishes an upper limit on the efficiencies of all real engines.
Carnot's theorem can be stated as follows: No real engine operating
between two energy reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot
engine operating between the same two reservoirs.
According to the third law of thermodynamics, it's impossible to
lower the temperature of a system to absolute zero in a finite number of
steps, so such reservoirs are not available, and the maximum efficiency
is always less than one. In most practical cases, the cold reservoir is near
room temperature, about 300 K, so increasing the efficiency requires
raising the temperature of the hot reservoir. All real engines operate irreversibly,
due to friction and the brevity of their cycles, and are therefore
less efficient than the Carnot engine.
A state variable called the entropy is related to the second law of thermodynamics.
We define entropy on a macroscopic scale as the German
physicist Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888) first expressed it in 1865. The concept
of entropy gained wide acceptance in part because it provided another
variable to describe the state of a system, along with pressure, volume, and
temperature. Its significance was enhanced when it was found that the entropy
of the Universe increases in all natural processes. This is yet another
way of stating the second law of thermodynamics.
Entropy originally found its place in thermodynamics, but its importance
grew tremendously as the field of statistical mechanics developed.
One of the main conclusions of the statistical mechanical approach is
that isolated systems tend toward greater disorder, and entropy is a measure
of that disorder.

Vibrations and Waves
UNIT 13
VIBRATION AND WAVES
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 13, answer
the questions after the texts
Periodic motion, from masses on springs to vibrations of atoms, is
one of the most important kinds of physical behavior. In this Unit we
take a more detailed look at Hooke's law, where the force is proportional
to the displacement, tending to restore objects to some equilibrium position.
A large number of physical systems can be successfully modeled
with this simple idea, including the vibrations of strings, the swinging of
a pendulum, and the propagation of waves of all kinds. All these physical
phenomena involve periodic motion.
Periodic vibrations can cause disturbances that move through a medium
in the form of waves. Many kinds of waves occur in nature, such
as sound waves, water waves, seismic waves, and electromagnetic
waves. These very different physical phenomena are described by common
terms and concepts introduced here.
Hooke's law
One of the simplest types of vibrational motion is that of an object
attached to a spring, previously discussed in the context of energy in
Unit 5. We assume that the object moves on a frictionless horizontal
surface. If the spring is stretched or compressed a small distance x from
its unstretched or equilibrium position and then released, it exerts a
force on the object. The value of the spring constant k is a measure of
the stiffness of the spring. Stiff springs have large k values, and soft
springs have small the spring constant values. A restoring force always
pushes or pulls the object toward the equilibrium position.
Simple harmonic motion occurs when the net force along the direction
of motion obeys Hooke's law - when the net force is proportional to
the displacement from the equilibrium point and is always directed toward
the equilibrium point. Not all periodic motions over the same path
can be classified as simple harmonic motion. A ball being tossed back
71
and forth between a parent and a child moves repetitively, but the motion
isn't simple harmonic motion, because the force acting on the ball
doesn't take the form of Hooke's law.
The following three concepts are important in discussing any kind of
periodic motion. The amplitude is the maximum distance of the object
from its equilibrium position. The period is the time it takes the object to
move through one complete cycle of motion. The frequency is the number
of complete cycles or vibrations per unit of time.
Elastic potential energy
A system of interacting objects has potential energy associated with
the configuration of the system. A compressed spring has potential energy
that, when allowed to expand, can do work on an object, transforming
spring potential energy into the object's kinetic energy. The energy
stored in a stretched or compressed spring or some other elastic material
is called elastic potential energy.
A valuable example of the relationship between simple harmonic
motion and circular motion can be seen in vehicles and machines that
use the back-and-forth motion of a piston to create rotational motion in a
wheel.
The period T represents the time required for one complete trip back
and forth, is also the time it takes the ball to make one complete circular
trip on the turntable. The inverse of period is frequency. The units of
frequency are cycles per second, or hertz(Hz).
Motion of a pendulum
A simple pendulum is mechanical system that exhibits periodic motion.
It consists of a small bob of mass m suspended by a light string of
length L fixed at its upper end. (By a light string, we mean that the
string's mass is assumed to be very small compared with the mass of the
bob and hence can be ignored.) When released, the bob swings to and
fro over the same path; but is its motion simple harmonic?
Answering this question requires examining the restoring force - the
force of gravity - that acts on the pendulum. The pendulum bob moves
along a circular arc, rather than back and forth in a straight line. When
the oscillations are small, however, the motion of the bob is nearly
straight, so Hooke's law may apply approximately.

Damped oscillation
The vibrating motions we have discussed so far have taken place in
ideal systems that oscillate indefinitely under the action of a linear restoring
force. In all real mechanical systems, forces of friction retard the
motion, so the systems don't oscillate indefinitely. The friction reduces
the mechanical energy of the system as time passes, and the motion is
said to be damped.
Shock absorbers in automobiles are one practical application of
damped motion. A shock absorber consists of a piston moving through a
liquid such as oil. The upper part of the shock absorber is firmly attached
to the body of the car. When the car travels over a bump in the
road, holes in the piston allow it to move up and down in the fluid in a
damped fashion.
Damped motion varies with the fluid used. For example, if the fluid
has a relatively low viscosity, the vibrating motion is preserved but the
amplitude of vibration decreases in time and the motion ultimately ceases.
This is known as underdamped oscillation. If the fluid viscosity is increased,
the object returns rapidly to equilibrium after it's released and
doesn't oscillate. In this case, the system is said to be critically damped. If
the viscosity is made greater still, the system is said to be overdamped.
Waves
The world is full of waves: sound waves, waves on a string, seismic
waves, and electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, radio waves,
television signals, and x-rays. All of these waves have as their source a
vibrating object, so we can apply the concepts of simple harmonic motion
in describing them.
In the case of sound waves, the vibrations that produce waves arise
from sources such as a person's vocal chords or a plucked guitar string.
The vibrations of electrons in an antenna produce radio or television
waves, and the simple up-and-down motion.
Interference of waves
Many interesting wave phenomena in nature require two or more
waves passing through the same region of space at the same time. Two
traveling waves can meet and pass through each other without being
destroyed or even altered. For instance, when two pebbles are thrown
into a pond, the expanding circular waves don't destroy each other. In
fact, the ripples pass through each other. Likewise, when sound waves
from two sources move through air, they pass through each other. In the
74
region of overlap, the resultant wave is found by adding the displacements
of the individual waves.
Reflection of waves
Whenever a traveling wave reaches a boundary, part or all of the
waves is reflected. Note that the reflected pulse is inverted. This can be
explained as follows: When the pulse meets the wall, the string exerts an
upward force on the wall.

UNIT 14
SOUND
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 14, answer
the questions after the texts
Sound waves are the most important example of longitudinal waves.
In this Unit we discuss the characteristics of sound waves: how they are
produced, what they are, and how they travel through matter. We then
investigate what happens when sound waves interfere with each other.
The insights gained in this Unit will help you understand how we hear.
Producing a sound wave
Whether it conveys the shrill whine of a jet engine or the soft melodies
of a crooner, any sound wave has its source in a vibrating object.
Musical instruments produce sounds in a variety of ways. The sound of
a clarinet is produced by a vibrating reed, the sound of a drum by the
vibration of the taut drumhead, the sound of a piano by vibrating strings,
and the sound from a singer by vibrating vocal cords.
Sound waves are longitudinal waves traveling through a medium,
such as air. In order to investigate how sound waves are produced, we
focus our attention on the tuning fork, a common device for producing
pure musical notes. A tuning fork consists of two metal prongs, or tines,
that vibrate when struck. Their vibration disturbs the air near them.
76
Characteristics of sound wave
The general motion of elements of air near a vibrating object is back
and forth between regions of compression and rarefaction. This backand-
forth motion of elements of the medium in the direction of the disturbance
is characteristic of a longitudinal wave. By contrast, in a transverse
wave, the vibrations of the elements of the medium are at right
angles to the direction of travel of the wave.
Categories of Sound Waves
Sound waves fall into three categories covering different ranges of
frequencies. Audible waves are longitudinal waves that lie within the
range of sensitivity of the human ear, approximately 20 to 20 000 Hz.
Infrasonic waves are longitudinal waves with frequencies below the audible
range. Earthquake waves are an example. Ultrasonic waves are
longitudinal waves with frequencies above the audible range for humans
and are produced by certain types of whistles. Animals such as dogs can
hear the waves emitted by these whistles.
Applications of Ultrasound
Ultrasonic waves are sound waves with frequencies greater than 20
kHz. Because of their high frequency and corresponding short wavelengths,
ultrasonic waves can be used to produce images of small objects
and are currently in wide use in medical applications, both as a diagnostic
tool and in certain treatments. Internal organs can be examined
via the images produced by the reflection and absorption of ultrasonic
waves. Although ultrasonic waves are far safer than x-rays, their images
don't always have as much detail. Certain organs, however, such as the
liver and the spleen, are invisible to x-rays but can be imaged with ultrasonic
waves.
The speed of sound
The speed of a sound wave in a fluid depends on the fluid's compressibility
and inertia. The speed of sound is much higher in solids than
in gases, because the molecules in a solid interact more strongly with
each other than do molecules in a gas. In general, sound travels faster
through solids than liquids and faster through liquids than gases, although
there are exceptions. The speed of sound also depends on the
temperature of the medium.

Energy and intensity of sound waves
As the tines of a tuning fork move back and forth through the air,
they exert a force on a layer of air and cause it to move. In other words,
the tines do work on the layer of air. The fact that the fork pours sound
energy into the air is one of the reasons the vibration of the fork slowly
dies out. Intensity of a wave on a given surface is defined as the rate at
which energy flows through the surface. The average intensity of a wave
on a given surface is defined as the rate at which energy flows through
the surface, divided by the surface area.
The faintest sounds the human ear can detect at a frequency of 1 000
Hz have an intensity of about 10~12W/m2. This intensity is called the
threshold of hearing. The loudest sounds the ear can tolerate have an
intensity of about 1 W/m2 (the threshold of pain). The relative intensity
of a sound is called the intensity level or decibel level.
Spherical and plane waves
If a small spherical object oscillates so that its radius changes periodically
with time, a spherical sound wave is produced. The wave moves
outward from the source at a constant speed. Because all points on the
vibrating sphere behave in the same way, we conclude that the energy in
a spherical wave propagates equally in all directions. This means that no
one direction is preferred over any other.
The distance between adjacent wave fronts equals the wavelength.
The radial lines pointing outward from the source and perpendicular to
the arcs are called rays.
Now consider a small portion of a wave front that is at a great distance
from the source. In this case, the rays are nearly parallel to each
other and the wave fronts are very close to being planes. At distances
from the source that are great relative to the wavelength, therefore, we
can approximate the wave front with parallel planes, called plane waves.
Any small portion of a spherical wave that is far from the source can be
considered a plane wave.
The Doppler effect
If a car or truck is moving while its horn is blowing, the frequency of
the sound you hear is higher as the vehicle approaches you and lower as
it moves away from you. This is one example of the Doppler effect,
named for the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler (1803-1853), who
79
discovered it. The same effect is heard if you're on a motorcycle and the
horn is stationary: the frequency is higher as you approach the source
and lower as you move away.
Standing wave
Standing waves can be set up in a stretched string by connecting one
end of the string to a stationary clamp and connecting the other end to a
vibrating object, such as the end of a tuning fork, or by shaking the hand
holding the string up and down at a steady rate. Traveling waves then
reflect from the ends and move in both directions on the string. The incident
and reflected waves combine according to the superposition principle.
If the string vibrates at exactly the right frequency, the wave appears
to stand still - hence its name, standing wave.
Forced vibrations and resonance
In Unit 13 we learned that the energy of a damped oscillator decreases
over time because of friction. It's possible to compensate for this energy
loss by applying an external force that does positive work on the
system.
For example, suppose an object-spring system having some natural
frequency of vibration is pushed back and forth by a periodic force with
frequency. The system vibrates at the frequency of the driving force.
This type of motion is referred to as a forced vibration. Its amplitude
reaches a maximum when the frequency of the driving force equals the
natural frequency of the system called the resonant frequency of the system.
Under this condition, the system is said to be in resonance.

ELECTRIC FORCES AND ELECTRIC FIELDS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 15, answer
the questions after the texts
Electricity is the lifeblood of technological civilization and modern
society. Without it, we revert to the mid-nineteenth century: no telephones,
no television, none of the household appliances that we take for
granted. Modern medicine would be a fantasy, and due to the lack of sophisticated
experimental equipment and fast computers - and especially the
slow dissemination of information - science and technology would grow
at a glacial pace.
Instead, with the discovery and harnessing of electric forces and fields,
we can view arrangements of atoms, probe the inner workings of the cell,
and send spacecraft beyond the limits of the solar system. All this has become
possible in just the last few generations of human life, a blink of
the eye compared to the million years our kind spent foraging the savannahs
of Africa.
Around 700 B.C. the ancient Greeks conducted the earliest known study
of electricity. It all began when someone noticed that a fossil material
called amber would attract small objects after being rubbed with wool.
Since then we have learned that this phenomenon is not restricted to amber
and wool, but occurs (to some degree) when almost any two nonconducting
substances are rubbed together.
We use the effect of charging by friction to begin an investigation of
electric forces. Coulomb's law is the fundamental law of force between
any two stationary charged particles. The concept of an electric field
associated with charges is introduced and its effects on other charged
particles described.
Properties of electric charges
After running a plastic comb through your hair, you will find that
the comb attracts bits of paper. The attractive force is often strong
enough to suspend the paper from the comb, defying the gravitational
82
pull of the entire Earth. The same effect occurs with other rubbed materials,
such as glass and hard rubber.
Another simple experiment is to rub an inflated balloon against wool (or
across your hair). On a dry day, the rubbed balloon will then stick to the wall
of a room often for hours. These materials have become electrically charged.
Experiments also demonstrate that there are two kinds of electric charge,
which Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) named positive and negative.
Objects usually contain equal amounts of positive and negative charge -
electrical forces between objects arise when those objects have net negative
or positive charges. Charge transfers readily from one type of material to
another. Rubbing the two materials together serves to increase the area of
contact, facilitating the transfer process.
An important characteristic of charge is that electric charge is always
conserved. Charge isn't created when two neutral objects are rubbed together;
rather, the objects become charged because negative charge is
transferred from one object to the other. One object gains a negative
charge while the other loses an equal amount of negative charge and
hence is left with a net positive charge.
Insulators and conductors
Substances can be classified in terms of their ability to conduct electric
charge. In conductors, electric charges move freely in response to an
electric force. All other materials are called insulators.
Glass and rubber are insulators. When such materials are charged by
rubbing, only the rubbed area becomes charged, and there is no tendency
for the charge to move into other regions of the material. In contrast,
materials such as copper, aluminum, and silver are good conductors.
When such materials are charged in some small region, the charge readily
distributes itself over the entire surface of the material. If you hold a copper
rod in your hand and rub the rod with wool or fur, it will not attract a
piece of paper. This might suggest that a metal can't be charged. However,
if you hold the copper rod with an insulator and then rub it with wool or
fur, the rod remains charged and attracts the paper. In the first case, the
electric charges produced by rubbing readily move from the copper
through your body and finally to ground. In the second case, the insulating
handle prevents the flow of charge to ground.
Semiconductors are a third class of materials, and their electrical properties
are somewhere between those of insulators and those of conductors.
Silicon and germanium are well-known semiconductors that are widely
used in the fabrication of a variety of electronic devices.

Coulomb's law
In 1785 Charles Coulomb (1736-1806) experimentally established the
fundamental law of electric force between two stationary charged particles.
An electric force has the following properties:
1. It is directed along a line joining the two particles and is inversely
proportional to the square of the separation distance between them.
2. It is proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges of
the two particles.
3. It is attractive if the charges are of opposite sign and repulsive
if the charges have the same sign.
The electric field
The gravitational force and the electrostatic force are both capable
of acting through space, producing an effect even when there isn't any
physical contact between the objects involved. Field forces can be discussed
in a variety of ways, but an approach developed by Michael Faraday
(1791-1867) is the most practical. In this approach, an electric field is
said to exist in the region of space around a charged object. The electric
field exerts an electric force on any other charged object within the
field. This differs from the Coulomb's law concept of a force exerted at a
distance, in that the force is now exerted by something - the field - that
is in the same location as the charged object.
Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium
A good electric conductor like copper, though electrically neutral,
contains charges (electrons) that aren't bound to any atom and are
free to move about within the material. When no net motion of charge
occurs within a conductor, the conductor is said to be in electrostatic
equilibrium.
In 1929 Robert J.Van de Graaff (1901-1967) designed and built an
electrostatic generator that has been used extensively in nuclear physics
research. The principles of its operation can be understood with knowledge
of the properties of electric fields and charges already presented in this
Unit.
Electric flux and Gauss's law
Gauss's law is essentially a technique for calculating the average electric
field on a closed surface, developed by Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-
1855). When the electric field, because of its symmetry, is constant everywhere
on that surface and perpendicular to it, the exact electric field can be
85
found. In such special cases, Gauss's law is far easier to apply than Coulomb's
law.
Gauss's law relates the electric flux through a closed surface and the total
charge inside that surface. A closed surface has an inside and an outside:
an example is a sphere. Electric flux is a measure of how much the
electric field vectors penetrate through a given surface. If the electric field
vectors are tangent to the surface at all points, for example, then they don't
penetrate the surface and the electric flux through the surface is zero.

UNIT 16
ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND CAPACITANCE
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 16, answer
the questions after the texts
By using the principle of conservation of energy, we are often able to
avoid working directly with forces when solving problems. The potential
energy concept is also useful in the study of electricity. Because the
Coulomb force is conservative, we can define an electric potential energy
corresponding to that force. In addition, we define an electric potential
- the potential energy per unit charge - corresponding to the electric
field.
With the concept of electric potential in hand, we can begin to understand
electric circuits, starting with an investigation of a common circuit
element called a capacitor. These simple devices store electrical energy
and have found uses virtually everywhere, from etched circuits on a microchip
to the creation of enormous bursts of power in fusion experiments.
Potential difference and electric potential
Electric potential energy and electric potential are closely related concepts.
The electric potential turns out to be just the electric potential energy
per unit charge. This is similar to the relationship between electric
force and the electric field, which is the electric force per unit charge.
87
The electric force is conservative, so the electric work depends only
on the endpoints of the path. Because the electric field is conservative,
the change in potential energy doesn't depend on the path. Because
electric potential energy is a scalar quantity, electric potential is also a
scalar quantity.
The electric potential difference is a measure of the change in electric
potential energy per unit charge. Alternately, the electric potential
difference is the work per unit charge that would have to be done by
some force to move a charge from point A to point В in the electric
field.
Released from rest, positive charges accelerate spontaneously from
regions of high potential to low potential. If a positive charge is given
some initial velocity in the direction of high potential, it can move in
that direction, but will slow аnd finally turn around, just like a ball
tossed upwards in a gravity field. Negative charges do exactly the opposite:
Released from rest, they accelerate from regions of low potential
toward regions of high potential. Work must be done on negative
charges to make them go in the direction of lower electric potential.
Electric potential and potential energy due to point charges
In electric circuits, a point of zero electric potential is often defined
by grounding (connecting to Earth) some point in the circuit. For example,
if the negative terminal of a 12-V battery were connected to ground,
it would be considered have a potential of zero, while the positive terminal
would have a potential of + 12 V. The potential difference created
by the battery, however, is only locally defined. In this Unit we describe
the electric potential of a point charge which is defined throughout
space.
The electric field of a point charge extends throughout space, so its
electric potential does, also. The zero point of electric potential could be
taken anywhere but is usually taken to be an infinite distance from the
charge, far from its influence and the influence of any other charges.
The electric potential of two or more charges is obtained by applying
the superposition principle: the total electric potential at some point due
to several point charges is the algebraic sum of the electric potentials due
to the individual charges.

Equipotential surfaces
A surface on which all points are at the same potential is called an
equipotential surface. The potential difference between any two points on
an equipotential surface is zero. Hence, no work is required to move a charge
at constant speed on an equipotential surface.
Equipotential surfaces have a simple relationship to the electric field:
The electric field at every point of an equipotential surface is perpendicular
to the surface. If the electric field E had a component parallel to the
surface, that component would produce an electric force on a charge
placed on the surface. This force would do work on the charge as it
moved from one point to another, in contradiction to the definition of an
equipotential surface.
Capacitance
A capacitor is a device used in a variety of electric circuits - for example,
to tune the frequency of radio receivers, eliminate sparking in
automobile ignition systems, or store short-term energy for rapid release
in electronic flash units. A capacitor consists of two parallel metal
plates separated by a distance d. Used in an electric circuit, the plates
are connected to the positive and negative terminals of a battery or some
other voltage source. When this connection is made, electrons are pulled
off one of the plates, leaving it with a charge of + Q, and are transferred
through the battery to the other plate, leaving it with a charge of –
Q. The transfer of charge stops when the potential difference across the
plates equals the potential difference of the battery. A charged capacitor
is a device that stores energy that can be reclaimed when needed for a
specific application.
The capacitance of a capacitor is the ratio of the magnitude of the
charge on either conductor (plate) to the magnitude of the potential
difference between the conductors (plates). SI Unit: farad (F) = coulomb
per volt (C/V).
Energy stored in a charged capacitor
Almost everyone who works with electronic equipment has at some
time verified that a capacitor can store energy. If the plates of a charged
capacitor are connected by a conductor such as a wire, charge transfers
from one plate to the other until the two are uncharged. The discharge can
often be observed as a visible spark. If you accidentally touched the opposite
plates of a charged capacitor, your fingers would act as a pathway by
which the capacitor could discharge, inflicting an electric shock. The de90
gree of shock would depend on the capacitance and voltage applied to the
capacitor. Where high voltages and large quantities of charge are present,
as in the power supply of a television set, such a shock can be fatal.
Capacitors with dielectrics
A dielectric is an insulating material, such as rubber, plastic, or waxed
paper. When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, the
capacitance increases. If the dielectric completely fills the space between
the plates, the capacitance is multiplied by the factor к, called the dielectric
constant.

UNIT 17
CURRENT AND RESISTANCE
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 17, answer
the questions after the texts
Many practical applications and devices are based on the principles of
static electricity, but electricity was destined to become an inseparable part
of our daily lives when scientists learned how to produce a continuous
flow of charge for relatively long periods of time using batteries. The battery
or voltaic cell was invented in 1800 by the Italian physicist Alessandro
Volta. Batteries supplied a continuous flow of charge at low potential, in
contrast to earlier electrostatic devices that produced a tiny flow of charge
at high potential for brief periods. This steady source of electric current
allowed scientists to perform experiments to learn how to control the flow
of electric charges in circuits. Today, electric currents power our lights,
radios, television sets, air conditioners, computers, and refrigerators. They
ignite the gasoline in automobile engines, travel through miniature compo92
nents making up the chips of microcomputers, and provide the power for
countless other invaluable tasks.
Electric current
If charges move in a direction perpendicular to a surface, the current is
the rate at which charge flows through this surface. One ampere of current
is equivalent to one coulomb of charge passing through the crosssectional
area in a time interval of 1 s. The direction of conventional current
used in this book is the direction positive charges flow. (This historical convention
originated about 200 years ago, when the ideas of positive and
negative charges were introduced.) In a common conductor such as copper,
the current is due to the motion of negatively charged electrons, so the
direction of the current is opposite the direction of motion of the electrons.
On the other hand, for a beam of positively-charged protons in an accelerator,
the current is in the same direction as the motion of the protons. In
some cases - gases and electrolytes, for example - the current is the result of
the flows of both positive and negative charges. Moving charges, whether
positive or negative, are referred to as charge carriers. In a metal, for example,
the charge carriers are electrons.
In electrostatics, where charges are stationary, the electric potential is
the same everywhere in a conductor. This is no longer true for conductors
carrying current: as charges move along a wire, the electric potential
is continually decreasing (except in the special case of superconductors).
The phrases flow of current and current flow are commonly used, but
here the word flow is redundant because current is already defined as a
flow (of charge). Avoid this construction!
Current and drift speed
Macroscopic currents can be related to the motion of the microscopic
charge carriers making up the current. It turns out that current depends on
the average speed of the charge carriers in the direction of the current, the
number of charge carriers per unit volume, and the size of the charge carried
by each.
If the carriers move with a constant average speed, it called the drift
speed. To understand the meaning of drift speed, consider a conductor in
which the charge carriers are free electrons. If the conductor is isolated,
these electrons undergo random motion similar to the motion of the molecules
of a gas. The drift speed is normally much smaller than the free elec93
trons' average speed between collisions with the fixed atoms of the conductor.
When a potential difference is applied between the ends of the
conductor (say, with a battery), an electric field is set up in the conductor,
creating an electric force on the electrons and hence a current. In reality,
the electrons don't simply move in straight lines along the conductor. Instead,
they undergo repeated collisions with the atoms of the metal, and the
result is a complicated zigzag motion with only a small average drift speed
along the wire. The energy transferred from the electrons to the metal atoms
during a collision increases the vibrational energy of the atoms and
causes a corresponding increase in the temperature of the conductor.
Current and voltage measurements in circuits
To study electric current in circuits, we need to understand how to
measure currents and voltages. The circuit consists of only a battery and a
light-bulb. The word "circuit" means "a closed loop" of some sort around
which current circulates. The battery pumps charge through the bulb and
around the loop. No charge would flow without a complete conducting
path from the positive terminal of the battery into one side of the bulb,
out the other side, and through the copper conducting wires back to the
negative terminal of the battery. To measure the current in the bulb, we
place an ammeter, the device for measuring current, in line with the bulb
so there is no path for the current to bypass the meter; all of the charge
passing through the bulb must also pass through the ammeter. The
voltmeter measures the potential difference, or voltage, between the two
ends of the bulb's filament.
Resistance and Ohm's law
When a voltage (potential difference) is applied across the ends of a
metallic conductor the current in the conductor is found to be proportional
to the applied voltage. The proportionality constant R is called the resistance
of the conductor. Resistance has SI units of volts per ampere,
called ohms.

The concepts of electric current, voltage, and resistance can be compared
with the flow of water in a river. As water flows downhill in a river
of constant width and depth, the flow rate (water current) depends on the
steepness of descent of the river and the effects of rocks, the riverbank, and
other obstructions. The voltage difference is analogous to the steepness,
and the resistance to the obstructions. Based on this analogy, it seems reasonable
that increasing the voltage applied to a circuit should increase the
current in the circuit, just as increasing the steepness of descent increases
the water current. Also, increasing the obstructions in the river's path will
reduce the water current, just as increasing the resistance in a circuit will
lower the electric current. Resistance in a circuit arises due to collisions
between the electrons carrying the current with fixed atoms inside the conductor.
For many materials, including most metals, experiments show that
the resistance remains constant over a wide range of applied voltages or
currents. This statement is known as Ohm's law.
Ohm's law is an empirical relationship valid only for certain materials.
Materials that obey Ohm's law, and hence have a constant resistance over a
wide range of voltages, are said to be ohmic. Materials having resistance
that changes with voltage or current are nonohmic.
Electrons don't move in straight-line paths through a conductor. Instead,
they undergo repeated collisions with the metal atoms. The resistance
of an ohmic conductor increases with length, which makes sense
because the electrons going through it must undergo more collisions in a
longer conductor. A smaller cross-sectional area also increases the resistance
of a conductor, just as a smaller pipe slows the fluid moving
through it. The resistance is proportional to the conductor's length and
inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, the constant of proportionality
is called the resistivity. The resistivity ρ, and hence the resistance,
of a conductor depends on a number of factors. One of the
most important is the temperature of the metal. For most metals, resistivity
increases with increasing temperature.
There is a class of metals and compounds with resistances that fall virtually
to zero below a certain temperature called the critical temperature.
These materials are known as superconductors.
Electrical energy and power
If a battery is used to establish an electric current in a conductor,
chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed into
kinetic energy of the charge carriers. This kinetic energy is quickly lost as
96
a result of collisions between the charge carriers and fixed atoms in the
conductor, causing an increase in the temperature of the conductor. In
this way, the chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed
into thermal energy.
Regardless of the ways in which you use electrical energy in your home,
you ultimately must pay for it or risk having your power turned off. The
unit of energy used by electric companies to calculate consumption, the
kilowatt-hour, is denned in terms of the unit of power and the amount of
time it's supplied.

UNIT 18
DIRECT-CURRENT CIRCUITS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 18, answer
the questions after the texts
Batteries, resistors, and capacitors can be used in various combinations to
construct electric circuits, which direct and control the flow of electricity
and the energy it conveys. Such circuits make possible all the modern
conveniences in a home - electric lights, electric stove tops and ovens,
washing machines, and a host of other appliances and tools. Electric circuits
are also found in our cars, in tractors that increase farming productivity,
and in all types of medical equipment that saves so many lives every day.
The analysis of the number of simple direct-current circuits is simplified
by the use of two rules known as Kirchhoff's rules, which follow from the
principle of conservation of energy and the law of conservation of charge.
Most of the circuits are assumed to be in steady state, which means that the
currents are constant in magnitude and direction.
Sources of emf
A current is maintained in a closed circuit by a source of emf. Among
such sources are any devices (for example, batteries and generators) that
increase the potential energy of the circulating charges. A source of emf
can be thought of as a "charge pump" that forces electrons to move in a
direction opposite the electrostatic field inside the source. The emf в of a
98
source is the work done per unit charge; hence the SI unit of emf is the
volt.
The terminal voltage when the current is zero, called the open-circuit
voltage. Terminal voltage also equal the potential difference across the
external resistance, often called the load resistance. The current in simple
circuit depends on both the resistance external to the battery and the internal
resistance of the battery. We will assume in our examples and problems
that the internal resistance of a battery in a circuit is negligible.
Resistors in series
When two or more resistors are connected end to end, they are
said to be in series. The resistors could be simple devices, such as
light-bulbs or heating elements. Regardless of how many resistors we
have in series, the sum of the potential differences across the resistors
is equal to the total potential difference across the combination.
The equivalent resistance of a series combination of resistors is the
algebraic sum of the individual resistances and is always greater than
any individual resistance.
Resistors in parallel
Now consider two resistors connected in parallel. In this case, the
potential differences across the resistors are the same because each is
connected directly across the battery terminals. The potential drop
must be the same for the two resistors and must also equal the potential
drop across the battery.
Kirchhoff's rules
We can analyze simple circuits using Ohm's law and the rules for series
and parallel combinations of resistors. However, there are many ways
in which resistors can be connected so that the circuits formed can't be
reduced to a single equivalent resistor. The procedure for analyzing more
complex circuits can be facilitated by the use of two simple rules called
Kirchhoff's rules.
RC-circuits
So far, we have been concerned with circuits with constant currents.
We now consider direct-current circuits containing capacitors, in which the
currents vary with time. We assume that the capacitor is initially uncharged
with the switch opened. After the switch is closed, the battery begins
to charge the plates of the capacitor and the charge passes through the
resistor. As the capacitor is being charged, the circuit carries a changing
current. The charging process continues until the capacitor is charged to its
99
maximum equilibrium value. Once the capacitor is fully charged, the current
in the circuit is zero. If we assume that the capacitor is uncharged before
the switch is closed, and if the switch is closed at t = 0, we find that
the charge on the capacitor varies with time.
Household circuits are a practical application of some of the ideas presented
in this Unit. In a typical installation, the utility company distributes
electric power to individual houses with a pair of wires, or power lines.
Electrical devices in a house are then connected in parallel to these lines.
The potential difference between the two wires is about 120V. (These currents
and voltages are actually alternating currents and voltages, but for the
present discussion we will assume that they are direct currents and voltages.)
One of the wires is connected to ground, and the other wire, sometimes
called the "hot" wire, is at a potential of 120V. A meter and a circuit
breaker (or a fuse) are connected in series with the wire entering the house.
In modern homes, circuit breakers are used in place of fuses.
Many heavy-duty appliances, such as electric ranges and clothes dryers,
require 240V to operate. The power company supplies this voltage by
providing, in addition to a live wire that is 120 V above ground potential,
another wire, also considered live, that is 120V below ground potential .
Therefore, the potential drop across the two live wires is 240V. An appliance
operating from a 240V line requires half the current of one operating
from a 120-V line; consequently, smaller wires can be used in the highervoltage
circuit without becoming overheated.
Electrical safety
A person can be electrocuted by touching a live wire (which commonly
is live because of a frayed cord and exposed conductors) while in contact
with ground. The ground contact might be made by touching a water
pipe (which is normally at ground potential) or by standing on the
ground with wet feet, because impure water is a good conductor. Obviously,
such situations should be avoided at all costs. Electric shock can result
in fatal burns, or it can cause the muscles of vital organs, such as the
heart, to malfunction. As an additional safety feature for consumers, electrical
equipment manufacturers now use electrical cords that have a third
wire, called a case ground.
Special power outlets called ground-fault interrupters (GFIs) are now being
used in kitchens, bathrooms, basements, and other hazardous areas of
new homes. They are designed to protect people from electrical shock by
sensing small currents - approximately 5 mA and greater - leaking to ground.

is found in the nervous system of animals. Specialized cells in the body
called neurons forma complex network that receives, processes, and
transmits information from one part of the body to another. The center of
this network is located in the brain, which has the ability to store and analyze
information. On the basis of this information, the nervous system controls
parts of the body.
The nervous system is highly complex and consists of about 1010 interconnected
neurons. Some aspects of the nervous system are well
known. Over the p 45 years, the method of signal propagation through the
nervous system has been established. The messages transmitted by neurons
are voltage pulses called action potentials. When a neuron receives a strong
enough stimulus, it produces identical voltage pulses that are actively propagated
along its structure. The strength of the stimulus is conveyed by the
number of pulses produced. When the pulses reach the end of the neuron,
they activate either muscle cells or other neurons. There is a "firing
threshold" for neurons: action potentials propagate along a neuron only if
the stimulus is sufficiently strong.

MAGNETISM
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 19, answer
the questions after the texts
In terms of applications, magnetism is one of the most important
fields in physics. Large electromagnets are used to pick up heavy loads.
Magnets are used in such devices as meters, and loudspeakers. Magnetic
tapes and disks are used routinely in sound- and video-recording equipment
and to store computer data. Intense magnetic fields are used in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices to explore the human body
103
with better resolution and greater safety than x-rays can provide. Giant
superconducting magnets are used in the cyclotrons that guide particles
into targets at nearly the speed of light, and magnetic bottles hold antimatter,
possibly the key to future space propulsion systems.
Magnetism is closely linked with electricity. Magnetic fields affect
moving charges, and moving charges produce magnetic fields. Changing
magnetic fields can even create electric fields. These phenomena
signify an underlying unity of electricity and magnetism, which James
Clerk Maxwell first described in the 19th century. The ultimate source
of any magnetic field is electric current.
Magnets
Most people have had experience with some form of magnet. You are
most likely familiar with the common iron horseshoe magnet that can pick
up iron-containing objects such as paper clips and nails. In the discussion
that follows, we assume the magnet has the shape of a bar. Iron objects are
most strongly attracted to either end of such a bar magnet, called its
poles. One end is called the north pole and the other the south pole. The
names come from the behavior of a magnet in the presence of Earth's
magnetic field. If a bar magnet is suspended from its midpoint by a piece
of string so that it can swing freely in a horizontal plane, it will rotate
until its north pole points to the north and its south pole points to the
south. The same idea is used to construct a simple compass. Magnetic
poles also exert attractive or repulsive forces on each other similar to the
electrical forces between charged objects. In fact, simple experiments with
two bar magnets show that like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract
each other.
Although the force between opposite magnetic poles is similar to the
force between positive and negative electric charges, there is an important
difference: positive and negative electric charges can exist in isolation of
each other; north and south poles don't. No matter how many times a
permanent magnet is cut, each piece always has a north pole and a south
pole. There is some theoretical basis for the speculation that magnetic
monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist in nature, and the attempt
to detect them is currently an active experimental field of investigation.
An unmagnetized piece of iron can be magnetized by stroking it with a
magnet. Magnetism can also be induced in iron (and other materials) by
other means. For example, if a piece of unmagnetized iron is placed
near a strong permanent magnet, the piece of iron eventually becomes
104
magnetized. The process can be accelerated by heating and then cooling
the iron.
Naturally occurring magnetic materials such as magnetite are magnetized
in this way because they have been subjected to Earth's magnetic
field for long periods of time. The extent to which a piece of material retains
its magnetism depends on whether it is classified as magnetically
hard or soft. Soft magnetic materials, such as iron, are easily magnetized,
but also tend to lose their magnetism easily. In contrast, hard magnetic
materials, such as cobalt and nickel, are difficult to magnetize, but tend
to retain their magnetism.
Forensic scientists use a technique similar to find fingerprints at a
crime scene. One way to find latent, or invisible, prints is by sprinkling a
powder of iron dust on a surface. The iron adheres to any perspiration or
body oils that are present and can be spread around on the surface with a
magnetic brush that never comes into contact with the powder or the
surface.
Earth’s magnetic field
A small bar magnet is said to have north and south poles, but it's
more accurate to say it has a "north-seeking" pole and a "south-seeking"
pole. By these expressions, we mean that if such a magnet is used as a
compass, one end will "seek," or point to, the geographic North Pole of
Earth and the other end will "seek," or point to, the geographic South
Pole of Earth. We conclude that the geographic North Pole of Earth corresponds
to a magnetic south pole, and the geographic South Pole of Earth
corresponds to a magnetic north pole.
If a compass needle is suspended in bearings that allow it to rotate in
the vertical plane as well as in the horizontal plane, the needle is horizontal
with respect to Earth's surface only near the equator. As the device is
moved northward, the needle rotates so that it points more and more toward
the surface of Earth. The angle between the direction of the magnetic
field and the horizontal is called the dip angle.
There is some evidence that the strength of a planet's magnetic field is
related to the planet's rate of rotation. For example, Jupiter rotates
faster than Earth, and recent space probes indicate that Jupiter's magnetic
field is stronger than Earth's, even though Jupiter lacks an iron
core. Venus, on the other hand, rotates more slowly than Earth, and its
magnetic field is weaker. Investigation into the cause of Earth's magnetism
continues.
105
Magnetic fields
Experiments show, that a stationary charged particle doesn't interact
with a static magnetic field. When a charged particle is moving through a
magnetic field, however, a magnetic force acts on it. This force has its
maximum value when the charge moves in a direction perpendicular to the
magnetic field lines, decreases in value at other angles, and becomes zero
when the particle moves along the field lines. This is quite different from
the electric force, which exerts a force on a charged particle whether it's
moving or at rest. Further, the electric force is directed parallel to the
electric field while the magnetic force on a moving charge is directed perpendicular
to the magnetic field.
The SI unit of magnetic field is the tesla (T), also called the weber
(Wb) per square meter. To determine the direction of the magnetic
force, we employ the right-hand rule.
If a magnetic field exerts a force on a single charged particle when
it moves through a magnetic field, it should be no surprise that magnetic
forces are exerted on a current-carrying wire. This follows from the fact
that the current is a collection of many charged particles in motion;
hence, the resultant force on the wire is due to the sum of the individual
forces on the charged particles. The force on the particles is transmitted
to the "bulk" of the wire through collisions with the atoms making
up the wire.
During a lecture demonstration in 1819, the Danish scientist Hans
Oersted (1777-1851) found that an electric current in a wire deflected a
nearby compass needle. This momentous discovery, linking a magnetic field
with an electric current for the first time, was the beginning of our understanding
of the origin of magnetism.
A simple experiment first carried out by Oersted in 1820 clearly
demonstrates that a current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field.
In this experiment, several compass needles are placed in a horizontal
plane near a long vertical wire. When there is no current in the wire, all
needles point in the same direction (that of Earth's field), as one would expect.
However, when the wire carries a strong, steady current, the needles
all deflect in directions tangent to the circle. These observations show that
the direction of magnetic field В is consistent with the following convenient
rule, right-hand rule number: Point the thumb of your right hand along a
wire in the direction of positive current. Your fingers then naturally curl
in the direction of the magnetic field B.

A general procedure for deriving equations to calculate the magnetic
field due to a long, straight wire carrying a current was proposed by the
French scientist Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836); it provides a relation
between the current in an arbitrarily shaped wire and the magnetic
field produced by the wire.
Magnetic force between two parallel conductors
A magnetic force acts on a current-carrying conductor when the conductor
is placed in an external magnetic field. Because a conductor carrying
a current creates a magnetic field around itself, it is easy to understand
that two current-carrying wires placed close together exert magnetic
forces on each other. Parallel conductors carrying currents in the same
direction attract each other parallel conductors carrying currents in opposite
directions repel each other.
Magnetic fields of current loops and solenoids
The strength of the magnetic field set up by a piece of wire carrying a
current can be enhanced at a specific location if the wire is formed into a
loop. If a long, straight wire is bent into a coil of several closely spaced
loops, the resulting device is a solenoid, often called an electromagnet.
This device is important in many applications because it acts as a magnet
only when it carries a current.
Magnetic domains
The magnetic field produced by a current in a coil of wire gives us a
hint as to what might cause certain materials to exhibit strong magnetic
properties. The magnetic properties of many materials can be explained
by the fact that an electron not only circles in an orbit, but also spins on
its axis like a top, with spin magnetic moment. In atoms containing many
electrons, the electrons usually pair up with their spins opposite each
other, so that their fields cancel each other. That is why most substances
are not magnets. However, in certain strongly magnetic materials, such
as iron, cobalt, and nickel, the magnetic fields produced by the electron
spins don't cancel completely. Such materials are said to be ferromagnetic.
In ferromagnetic materials, strong coupling occurs between neighboring
atoms, forming large groups of atoms with spins that are aligned.
Called domains, the sizes of these groups typically range from about
10~4 cm to 0.1 cm.

UNIT 20
INDUCED VOLTAGES AND INDUCTANCE
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 20, answer
the questions after the texts
In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current exerted
a force on a magnetic compass. Although there had long been speculation
that such a relationship existed, Oersted's finding was the first evidence
of a link between electricity and magnetism. Because nature is often symmetric,
the discovery that electric currents produce magnetic fields led scientists
to suspect that magnetic fields could produce electric currents. Indeed,
experiments conducted by Michael Faraday in England and independently
by Joseph Henry in the United States in 1831 showed that a
changing magnetic field could induce an electric current in a circuit. The
results of these experiments led to a basic and important law known as Faraday's
law.
Induced emf and magnetic flux
An experiment first conducted by Faraday demonstrated that a current
can be produced by a changing magnetic field. The apparatus consists of a
coil connected to a switch and a battery. We will refer to this coil as the
primary coil and to the corresponding circuit as the primary circuit. The
coil is wrapped around an iron ring to intensify the magnetic field produced
by the current in the coil. A second coil, at the right, is wrapped
around the iron ring and is connected to an ammeter. This is called the
secondary coil, and the corresponding circuit is called the secondary circuit.
It's important to notice that there is no battery in the secondary circuit.
At first glance, you might guess that no current would ever be detected
in the secondary circuit. However, when the switch in the primary circuit is
suddenly closed, something amazing happens: the ammeter measures a
current in the secondary circuit and then returns to zero! When the switch
110
is opened again, the ammeter reads a current in the opposite direction an
again returns to zero. Finally, whenever there is a steady current in the
primal circuit, the ammeter reads zero. From observations such as these,
Faraday concluded that an electric current could be produced by a changing
magnetic field.
In order to evaluate induced emfs quantitatively, we need to understand
what factors affect the phenomenon. While changing magnetic fields always
induce electric fields, there are also situations in which the magnetic
field remains constant, yet an induced electric field is still produced. The
best example of this is an electric generator: A loop of conductor rotating
in a constant magnetic field creates an electric current.
The physical quantity associated with magnetism that creates an
electric field is a changing magnetic flux. SI unit: weber (Wb).
Faraday's law of induction
The usefulness of the concept of magnetic flux can be made obvious by
another simple experiment that demonstrates the basic idea of electromagnetic
induction. If a magnet is moved toward the loop, the ammeter reads a
current in one direction. If the magnet is moved away from the loop, the
ammeter reads a current in the opposite direction. If the magnet is held
stationary and the loop is moved either toward or away from the magnet,
the ammeter also reads a current. From these observations, it can be
concluded that a current is set up in the circuit as long as there is relative motion
between the magnet and the loop. The same experimental results are
found whether the loop moves or the magnet moves. We call such a current
an induced current, because it is produced by an induced emf.
In each case, an emf is induced in a circuit when the magnetic flux
through the circuit changes with time. It turns out that the instantaneous
emf induced in a circuit equals the negative of the rate of change of
magnetic flux with respect to time through the circuit. This is Faraday's law
of magnetic induction.
The polarity determines which of two different directions current
will flow in a loop, a direction given by Lenz's law: The current caused by
the induced emf travels in the direction that creates a magnetic field with
flux opposing the change in the original flux through the circuit.

Generators
Generators and motors are important practical devices that operate
on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The alternating-current
(AC) generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical
energy. In its simplest form, the AC generator consists of a wire loop
rotated in a magnetic field by some external means. In commercial power
plants, the energy required to rotate the loop can be derived from a
variety of sources. For example, in a hydroelectric plant, falling water
directed against the blades of a turbine produces the rotary motion; in a
coal-fired plant, heat produced by burning coal is used to convert water
to steam, and this steam is directed against the turbine blades. As the
loop rotates, the magnetic flux through it changes with time, inducing an
emf and a current in an external circuit. The ends of the loop are connected
to slip rings that rotate with the loop.
The components of the direct current (DC) generator are essentially the
same as those of the AC generator, except that the contacts to the rotating
loop are made by a split ring, or commutator. A pulsating DC current
is not suitable for most applications. To produce a steady DC current,
commercial DC generators use many loops and commutators distributed
around the axis of rotation so that the sinusoidal pulses from the
loops overlap in phase. When these pulses are superimposed, the DC
output is almost free of fluctuations.
Self-induction
When the switch is closed, the current doesn't immediately change
from zero to its maximum value. The law of electromagnetic induction -
Faraday's law - prevents this. What happens instead is the following: as the
current increases with time, the magnetic flux through the loop due to this
current also increases. The increasing flux induces an emf in the circuit
that opposes the change in magnetic flux. The net potential difference
across the resistor is the emf of the battery minus the opposing induced
emf As the magnitude of the current increases, the rate of increase
lessens and hence the induced emf decreases. This opposing emf results
in a gradual increase in the current. For the same reason, when the
switch is opened, the current doesn't immediately fall to zero. This
effect is called self-induction because the changing flux through the
circuit arises from the circuit itself. The emf that is set up in the circuit is
called a self-induced emf.
113
The inductance of a coil depends on the cross-sectional area of the
coil and other quantities, all of which can be grouped under the general
heading of geometric factors. The SI unit of inductance is the henry (H).
A circuit element that has a large inductance, such as a closely
wrapped coil of many turns, is called an inductor. The circuit symbol
for an inductor is RL. The emf induced by an inductor prevents a battery
from establishing an instantaneous current in a circuit. The battery has to
do work to produce a current. We can think of this needed work as energy
stored in the inductor in its magnetic field.

UNIT 21
ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 21, answer
the questions after the texts
Every time we turn on a television set, a stereo system, or any of a
multitude of other electric appliances, we call on alternating currents
(AC) to provide the power to operate them. We begin our study of AC
circuits by examining the characteristics of a circuit containing a source
of emf and one other circuit element: a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor.
Then we examine what happens when these elements are connected
in combination with each other. Our discussion is limited to simple series
configurations of the three kinds of elements.
We conclude this Unit with a discussion of electromagnetic waves,
which are composed of fluctuating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic
waves in the form of visible light enable us to view the world
around us; infrared waves warm our environment; radio-frequency waves
carry our television and radio programs, as well as information about processes
in the core of our galaxy. X-rays allow us to perceive structures
hidden inside our bodies, and study properties of distant, collapsed stars.
Light is key to our understanding of the universe.
115
Resistors in an AC circuit
An AC circuit consists of combinations of circuit elements and an
AC generator or an AC source, which provides the alternating current.
To explain the concept of alternating current, we begin by discussing the
current-versus-time curve. The current and voltage are in step with each
other because they vary identically with time. Because the current and
the voltage reach their maximum values at the same time, they are said
to be in phase. Notice that the average value of the current over one cycle
is zero. This is because the current is maintained in one direction
(the positive direction) for the same amount of time and at the same
magnitude as it is in the opposite direction (the negative direction).
However, the direction of the current has no effect on the behavior of
the resistor in the circuit: the collisions between electrons and the fixed
atoms of the resistor result in an increase in the resistor's temperature
regardless of the direction of the current.
The important quantity in an AC circuit is a special kind of average
value of current, called the rms current - the direct current that dissipates
the same amount of energy in a resistor that is dissipated by the actual
alternating current. To find the rms current, we first square the current,
then find its average value, and finally take the square root of this average
value. Hence, the rms current is the square root of the average
(mean) of the square of the current. In this Unit we use rms values when
discussing alternating currents and voltages. One reason is that AC ammeters
and voltmeters are designed to read rms values. Further, if we
use rms values, many of the equations for alternating current will have
the same form as those used in the study of direct-current (DC) circuits.
Capacitors in an AC circuit
To understand the effect of a capacitor on the behavior of a circuit
containing an AC voltage source, we first review what happens when a
capacitor is placed in a circuit containing a DC source, such as a battery.
When the switch is closed in a series circuit containing a battery, a resistor,
and a capacitor, the initial charge on the plates of the capacitor is
zero. The motion of charge through the circuit is therefore relatively
free, and there is a large current in the circuit. As more charge accumulates
on the capacitor, the voltage across it increases, opposing the current.
After some time interval, which depends on the time constant RC,
the current approaches zero. Consequently, a capacitor in a DC circuit
limits or impedes the current so that it approaches zero after a brief time.
116
At high frequency, there is less time available to charge the capacitor,
so less charge and voltage accumulate on the capacitor, which translates
into less opposition to the flow of charge and, consequently, a
higher current. The analogy between capacitive reactance and resistance
means that we can write an equation of the same form as Ohm's law to
describe AC circuits containing capacitors.
Inductors in an AC circuit
Now consider an AC circuit consisting only of an inductor connected
to the terminals of an AC source. The changing current output of the
generator produces a back emf that impedes the current in the circuit.
The effective resistance of the coil in an AC circuit is measured by a
quantity called the inductive reactance. This occurs because back emfs
always oppose the change in the current.
The RLC series circuit
We now consider when an inductor, a capacitor, and a resistor are
combined. To account for the different phases of the voltage drops, we
use a technique involving vectors. We represent the voltage across each
element with a rotating vector. It's convenient to define a parameter
called the impedance Z of the circuit. Both the impedance and, therefore,
the current in an AC circuit depend on the resistance, the inductance,
the capacitance, and the frequency (because the reactances are frequency
dependent).
Power in an AC circuit
No power losses are associated with pure capacitors and pure inductors
in an AC circuit. A pure capacitor, by definition, has no resistance
or inductance, while a pure inductor has no resistance or capacitance.
These are idealizations: in a real capacitor, for example, inductive effects
could become important at high frequencies.
The power delivered by an AC source to any circuit depends on the
phase difference between the source voltage and the resulting current.
This fact has many interesting applications. For example, factories often
use devices such as large motors in machines, generators, and transformers
that have a large inductive load due to all the windings. To deliver
greater power to such devices without using excessively high voltages,
factory technicians introduce capacitance in the circuits to shift the phase.
Resonance in a series RLC circuit
The rms current in a series RLC has its maximum value when the impedance
has its minimum value. In such a circumstance, the impedance of
117
the circuit reduces to Z = R. The frequency at which this happens is called
the resonance frequency of the circuit.
The tuning circuit of a radio is an important application of a series
resonance circuit. The radio is tuned to a particular station (which
transmits a specific radio-frequency signal) by varying a capacitor,
which changes the resonance frequency of the tuning circuit. When this
resonance frequency matches that of the incoming radio wave, the current
in the tuning circuit increases.
The transformer
It's often necessary to change a small AC voltage to a larger one or
vice versa. Such changes are effected with a device called a transformer.
In its simplest form, the AC transformer consists of two coils of wire
wound around a core of soft iron. The purpose of the common iron core
is to increase the magnetic flux and to provide a medium in which nearly
all the flux through one coil passes through the other.
Maxwell's predictions
During the early stages of their study and development, electric and
magnetic phenomena were thought to be unrelated. In 1865, however,
James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) provided a mathematical theory that
showed a close relationship between all electric and magnetic phenomena.
In addition to unifying the formerly separate fields of electricity and
magnetism, his brilliant theory predicted that electric and magnetic
fields can move through space as waves.
From Faraday's law and from Maxwell's own generalization of Ampere's
law, Maxwell calculated the speed of the waves to be equal to the
speed of light. He concluded that visible light and other electromagnetic
waves consist of fluctuating electric and magnetic fields traveling
through empty space, with each varying field inducing the other! This
was truly one of the greatest discoveries of science, on a par with Newton's
discovery of the laws of motion. Like Newton's laws, it had a profound
influence on later scientific developments.
In 1887, after Maxwell's death, Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) was the
first to generate and detect electromagnetic waves in a laboratory setting,
using LC circuits.

The spectrum of electromagnetic waves
It is now known that other forms of electromagnetic waves exist that are
distinguished by their frequencies and wavelengths. Brief descriptions of
the wave types follow, in order of decreasing wavelength. There is no sharp
division between one kind of electromagnetic wave and the next. All forms
of electromagnetic radiation are produced by accelerating charges.
Radio waves are the result of charges accelerating through conducting
wires. They are, of course, used in radio and television communication

Microwaves (short-wavelength radio waves) are generated by electronic
devices. Their short wavelengths make them well suited for the

molecular properties of matter.
Infrared waves produced by hot objects and molecules. They are
readily absorbed by most materials. Infrared radiation has many practical

large quantities has harmful effects on humans.
X-rays are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths from about 10

REFLECTION AND REFRACTION OF LIGHT
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 22, answer
the questions after the texts
Light has a dual nature. In some experiments it acts like a particle,
while in others it acts like a wave. In this part of the book, we concentrate
on the aspects of light that are best understood through the wave model.
First we discuss the reflection of light at the boundary between two media
and the refraction (bending) of light as it travels from one medium into
another. We use these ideas to study the refraction of light as it passes
through lenses and the reflection of light from mirrored surfaces. Finally,
we describe how lenses and mirrors can be used to view objects with telescopes
and microscopes and how lenses are used in photography. The ability
to manipulate light has greatly enhanced our capacity to investigate and
understand the nature of the universe.
The nature of light
Until the beginning of the 19th century, light was modeled as a stream
of particles emitted by a source that stimulated the sense of sight on entering
the eye. The chief architect of the particle theory of light was Newton.
With this theory, he provided simple explanations of some known experimental
facts concerning the nature of light-namely, the laws of reflection
and refraction.
Most scientists accepted Newton's particle theory of light. During Newton's
lifetime, however, another theory was proposed. In 1678, the Dutch
physicist and astronomer Christian Huygens (1629-1695) showed that a
wave theory of light could also explain the laws of reflection and refraction.
The wave theory didn't receive immediate acceptance, for several
reasons. First, all the waves known at the time (sound, water, and so on)
traveled through some sort of medium, but light from the Sun could travel
to Earth through empty space. Further, it was argued that if light were
122
some form of wave, it would bend around obstacles; hence, we should be
able to see around corners. It is now known that light does indeed bend
around the edges of objects. This phenomenon, known as diffraction, is
difficult to observe because light waves have such short wavelengths. Even
though experimental evidence for the diffraction of light was discovered
by Francesco Grimaldi (1618-1663) around 1660, for more than a century
most scientists rejected the wave theory and adhered to Newton's particle
theory, probably due to Newton's great reputation as a scientist.
The first clear demonstration of the wave nature of light was provided
in 1801 by Thomas Young (1773-1829), who showed that under appropriate
conditions, light exhibits interference behavior. Light waves emitted by
a single source and traveling along two different paths can arrive at some
point and combine and cancel each other by destructive interference. Such
behavior couldn't be explained at that time by a particle model, because
scientists couldn't imagine how two or more particles could come together
and cancel each other. The most important development in the theory of
light was the work of Maxwell, who predicted in 1865, that light was a
form of high-frequency electromagnetic wave.
Although the classical theory of electricity and magnetism explained
most known properties of light, some subsequent experiments couldn't be
explained by the assumption that light was a wave. The most striking of
these was the photoelectric effect, discovered by Hertz. Hertz found that
clean metal surfaces emit charges when exposed to ultraviolet light.
In 1905, Einstein published a paper that formulated the theory of
light quanta ("particles") and explained the photoelectric effect. He
reached the conclusion that light was composed of corpuscles, or discontinuous
quanta of energy. These corpuscles or quanta are now called
photons to emphasize their particle-like nature. According to Einstein's
theory, the energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of the
electromagnetic wave associated with it, or: E=hf, where h - is Planck's
constant.
Reflection and refraction
An important property of light that can be understood based on common
experience is the following: light travels in a straight-line path in a
homogeneous medium, until it encounters a boundary between two different
materials. When light strikes a boundary, it is either reflected from that
123
boundary, passes into the material on the other side of the boundary, or
partially does both.
The preceding observation leads us to use what is called the ray approximation
to represent beams of light. For example, a beam of sunlight
passing through a darkened room traces out the path of a light ray. We will
also make use of the concept of wave fronts of light. A wave front is a surface
passing through the points of a wave that have the same phase and
amplitude. The rays, corresponding to the direction of wave motion, are
straight lines perpendicular to the wave fronts. When light rays travel in
parallel paths, the wave fronts are planes perpendicular to the rays.
When a light ray traveling in a transparent medium encounters a
boundary leading into a second medium, part of the incident ray is reflected
back into the first medium. The reflected rays are parallel to each other.
The reflection of light from such a smooth surface is called specular reflection.
Reflection from any rough surface is known as diffuse reflection.
You may have noticed a common occurrence in photographs of individuals:
their eyes appear to be glowing red. This occurs when a photographic
flash device is used and the flash unit is close to the camera lens.
Light from the flash unit enters the eye and is reflected back along its original
path from the retina. This type of reflection back along the original
direction is called retroreflection.
When light passes from one transparent medium to another, it's refracted
because the speed of light is different in the two media. The index of
refraction, n, of a medium is defined as the ratio c/v, where с – is speed of
light in vacuum, v – is speed of light in a medium. If we make careful
measurements, however, we find that the index of refraction in anything
but vacuum depends on the wavelength of light. The dependence of the
index of refraction on wavelength is called dispersion.
When light strikes a prism, a ray of light of a single wavelength emerges
bent away from its original direction of travel by an angle, called the
angle of deviation. Prisms are often used in an instrument known as a
prism spectrometer. The dispersion of light into a spectrum is demonstrated
most vividly in nature through the formation of a rainbow, often seen
by an observer positioned between the Sun and a rain shower.

Huygens' principle
The laws of reflection and refraction can be deduced using a geometric
method proposed by Huygens in 1678. Huygens assumed that light
is a form of wave motion rather than a stream of particles. He had no
knowledge of the nature of light or of its electromagnetic character. Nevertheless,
his simplified wave model is adequate for understanding many
practical aspects of the propagation of light.
In Huygens' construction, all points on a given wave front are taken as
point sources for the production of spherical secondary waves, called wavelets,
which propagate in the forward direction with speeds characteristic of waves in
that medium. After some time has elapsed, the new position of the wave front
is the surface tangent to the wavelets.
Total internal reflection
An interesting effect called total internal reflection can occur when
light encounters the boundary between a medium with a higher index of
refraction and one with a lower index of refraction. Total internal reflection
occurs only when light attempts to move from a medium of higher
index of refraction to a medium of lower index of refraction.
Interesting application of total internal reflection is the use of solid
glass or transparent plastic rods to "pipe" light from one place to another.
Such a light pipe can be quite flexible if thin fibers are used rather than
thick rods. If a bundle of parallel fibers is used to construct an optical
transmission line, images can be transferred from one point to another.
Very little light intensity is lost in these fibers as a result of reflections on
the sides. Any loss of intensity is due essentially to reflections from the two
ends and absorption by the fiber material. Fiber-optic devices are particularly
useful for viewing images produced at inaccessible locations. Physicians
often use fiber-optic cables to aid in the diagnosis and correction of certain
medical problems without the intrusion of major surgery.

MIRRORS AND LENSES
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 23, answer
the questions after the texts
The development of the technology of mirrors and lenses led to a revolution
in the progress of science. These devices, relatively simple to construct
from cheap materials, led to microscopes and telescopes, extending
human sight and opening up new pathways to knowledge, from microbes to
distant planets.
This Unit covers the formation of images when plane and spherical light
waves fall on plane and spherical surfaces. Images can be formed by reflection
from mirrors or by refraction through lenses. In our study of mirrors
and lenses, we continue to assume that light travels in straight lines (the
ray approximation), ignoring diffraction.
Flat mirrors
Consider the flat mirror. Light rays leave the source and are reflected
from the mirror. Regardless of the system under study, images are formed at
the point where rays of light actually intersect or where they appear to
originate. Images are classified as real or virtual. In the formation of a real
image, light actually passes through the image point. For a virtual image,
the light doesn't pass through the image point, but appears to come (diverge)
from there. In fact, the images seen in flat mirrors are always virtual
(for real objects). Real images can be displayed on a screen (as at a movie),
but virtual images cannot.
Finally, note that a flat mirror produces an image having an apparent
left-right reversal. You can see this reversal standing in front of a mirror
and raising your right hand. Your image in the mirror raises his left
hand. Likewise, your hair appears to be parted on the opposite side, and
a mole on your right cheek appears to be on your image's left cheek..
Images formed by spherical mirrors
A spherical mirror, as its name implies, has the shape of a segment of
a sphere. A spherical mirror with a silvered inner, concave surface, is
called a concave mirror. After reflecting from the mirror, rays converge
to meet at point, called the image point. The rays then continue and diverge
from this point as if there were an object there. As a result, a real
image is formed. Whenever reflected light actually passes through a point,
the image formed there is real.

We often assume that all rays that diverge from the object make small
angles with the principal axis. Rays that make a large angle with the
principal axis converge to other points on the principal axis, producing
a blurred image. This effect, called spherical aberration, is present
to some extent with any spherical mirror.
A convex mirror is silvered so that light is reflected from the outer,
convex surface. This is sometimes called a diverging mirror because the
rays from any point on the object diverge after reflection, as though
they were coming from some point behind the mirror.
We won't derive any equations for convex spherical mirrors. If we
did, we would find that the equations developed for concave mirrors
can be used with convex mirrors if particular sign conventions are
used. We call the region in which light rays move the front side of the
mirror, and the other side, where virtual images are formed, the back side.
We can conveniently determine the positions and sizes of images
formed by mirrors by constructing ray diagrams. This kind of graphical
construction tells us the overall nature of the image and can be used to
check parameters calculated from the mirror and magnification equations.
Making a ray diagram requires knowing the position of the object
and the location of the center of curvature.
Thin lens
A typical thin lens consists of a piece of glass or plastic, ground so that
each of its two refracting surfaces is a segment of either a sphere or a
plane. Lenses are commonly used to form images by refraction in optical
instruments, such as cameras, telescopes, and microscopes. The equation
that relates object and image distances for a lens is virtually identical to
the mirror equation, and the method used to derive it is also similar.
The distance from the focal point to the lens is called the focal
length. The focal length is the image distance that corresponds to an infinite
object distance. Recall that we are considering the lens to be very
thin. As a result, it makes no difference whether we take the focal
length to be the distance from the focal point to the surface of the lens
or the distance from the focal point to the center of the lens, because
the difference between these two lengths is negligible. A thin lens has
two focal points, one on each side of the lens. One focal point corre130
sponds to parallel rays traveling from the left and the other corresponds
to parallel rays traveling from the right.
Note that a converging lens has a positive focal length under this convention
and a diverging lens has a negative focal length. Hence the names
positive and negative are often given to these lenses.
Lens and mirror aberrations
One of the basic problems of systems containing mirrors and lenses is
the imperfect quality of the images, which is largely the result of defects
in shape and form. The simple theory of mirrors and lenses assumes that
rays make small angles with the principal axis and that all rays reaching
the lens or mirror from a point source are focused at a single point, producing
a sharp image. This is not always true in the real world. Where
the approximations used in this theory do not hold, imperfect images are
formed.
The departures of real (imperfect) images from the ideal predicted by the
simple theory are called aberrations. Two common types of aberrations are
spherical aberration and chromatic aberration. Spherical aberration results
from the fact that the focal points of light rays passing far from the principal
axis of a spherical lens (or mirror) are different from the focal points
of rays with the same wavelength passing near the axis. Chromatic aberration
for a diverging lens is opposite that for a converging lens. Chromatic
aberration can be greatly reduced by a combination of converging and
diverging lenses.

WAVE OPTICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 24, answer
the questions after the texts
Colors swirl on a soap bubble as it drifts through the air on a summer
day, and vivid rainbows reflect from the filth of oil films in the puddles of a
dirty city street. Beachgoers, covered with thin layers of oil, wear their
coated sunglasses that absorb half the incoming light. In laboratories, scientists
determine the precise composition of materials by analyzing the light
they give off when hot, and in observatories around the world, telescopes
gather light from distant galaxies, filtering out individual wavelengths in
bands and thereby determining the speed of expansion of the universe.
Understanding how these rainbows are made and how certain scientific
instruments can determine wavelengths is the domain of wave optics. Light
can be viewed as either a particle or a wave. Geometric optics, the subject of
the previous Unit, depends on the particle nature of light. Wave optics depends
on the wave nature of light. The three primary topics we examine in
this Unit are interference, diffraction, and polarization. These phenomena
can't be adequately explained with ray optics, but can be understood if light
is viewed as a wave.
Conditions for interference
In our discussion of interference of mechanical waves in Unit 13, we
found that two waves could add together either constructively or destructively.
In constructive interference, the amplitude of the resultant wave is
greater than that of either of the individual waves, whereas in destructive
interference, the resultant amplitude is less than that of either individual
wave. Light waves also interfere with each other. Fundamentally, all interference
associated with light waves arises when the electromagnetic fields
that constitute the individual waves combine.
Two sources (producing two traveling waves) are needed to create interference.
To produce a stable interference pattern, the individual waves
must maintain a constant phase with one another. When this situation
prevails, the sources are said to be coherent. The sound waves emitted by
two side-by-side loudspeakers driven by a single amplifier can produce
interference because the two speakers respond to the amplifier in the
same way at the same time - they are in phase.
133
If two light sources are placed side by side, however, no interference
effects are observed, because the light waves from one source are emitted
independently of the waves from the other source; hence, the emissions
from the two sources don't maintain a constant phase relationship
with each other during the time of observation. The result is that no interference
effects are observed, because the eye can't follow such short-term
changes. Ordinary light sources are said to be incoherent.
Currently it's much more common to use a laser as a coherent source
to demonstrate interference. A laser produces an intense, coherent, monochromatic
beam over a width of several millimeters. This means that the
laser may be used to illuminate multiple slits directly and that interference
effects can be easily observed in a fully lighted room.
Thomas Young first demonstrated interference in light waves from
two sources in 1801. Light is incident on a screen containing a narrow
slit. The light waves emerging from this slit arrive at a second screen
that contains two narrow, parallel slits. These slits serve as a pair of
coherent light sources because waves emerging from them originate
from the same wave front and therefore are always in phase. The light
from the two slits produces a visible pattern on screen consisting of a
series of bright and dark parallel bands called fringes.
Another simple, yet ingenious, arrangement for producing an interference
pattern with a single light source is known as Lloyd's mirror.
Interference in thin films
Interference effects are commonly observed in thin films, such
as the thin surface of a soap bubble or thin layers of oil on water.
The varied colors observed when incoherent white light is incident
on such films result from the interference of waves reflected from
the two surfaces of the film.
Another method for observing interference in light waves is to place
a planoconvex lens on top of a flat glass surface. With this arrangement,
the air film between the glass surfaces varies in thickness from zero at the
point of contact to some value. The circular fringes, discovered by Newton,
are called Newton's rings.
Compact disks (CD's) and digital video disks (DVD's) have revolutionized
the computer and entertainment industries by providing fast access;
high-density storage of text, graphics, and movies; and high-quality sound
recordings. The data on these disks are stored digitally as a series of zeros
and ones, and these zeros and ones are read by laser light reflected from
134
the disk. Strong reflections (constructive interference) from the disk are
chosen to represent zeros and weak reflections (destructive interference)
represent ones.

Diffraction
Suppose a light beam is incident on two slits, as in Young's double-slit
experiment. If the light truly traveled in straight-line paths after passing
through the slits, the waves wouldn't overlap and no interference pattern
would be seen. Instead, Huygens's principle requires that the waves
spread out from the slits. In other words, the light bends from a straightline
path and enters the region that would otherwise be shadowed. This
spreading out of light from its initial line of travel is called diffraction.
One type of diffraction, called Fraunhofer diffraction, occurs when the
rays leave the diffracting object in parallel directions. Fraunhofer diffraction
can be achieved experimentally either by placing the observing
screen far from the slit or by using a converging lens to focus the parallel
rays on a nearby screen.
The diffraction grating, a useful device for analyzing light sources,
consists of a large number of equally spaced parallel slits. A grating
can be made by scratching parallel lines on a glass plate with a precision
machining technique. The clear panes between scratches act like
slits. A typical grating contains several thousand lines per centimeter.
Polarization of light waves
In Unit 21, we described the transverse nature of electromagnetic
waves. The phenomenon of polarization, described in this Unit, is firm
evidence of the transverse nature of electromagnetic waves. An ordinary
beam of light consists of a large number of electromagnetic waves emitted
by the atoms or molecules of the light source. The vibrating charges
associated with the atoms act as tiny antennas. Each atom produces a wave
with its own orientation, corresponding to the direction of atomic vibration.
However, because all directions of vibration are possible, the resultant
electromagnetic wave is a superposition of waves produced by the
individual atomic sources. The result is an unpolarized light wave.
It's possible to obtain a linearly polarized beam from an unpolarized
beam by removing all waves from the beam except those with electric
field vectors that oscillate in a single plane. The most common technique
for polarizing light is to use a material that transmits waves having electric
field vectors that vibrate in a plane parallel to a certain direction and
absorbs those waves with electric field vectors vibrating in directions perpendicular
to that direction.
In 1932, E. H. Land discovered a material, which he called Polaroid,
that polarizes light through selective absorption by oriented molecules.
136
This material is fabricated in thin sheets of long-chain hydrocarbons,
which are stretched during manufacture so that the molecules align.
Polarizing material reduces the intensity of light passing through it. An
unpolarized light beam is incident on the first polarizing sheet, called the
polarizer. The light that passes through this sheet is polarized vertically. A
second polarizing sheet, called the analyzer, intercepts this beam with its
transmission axis at an angle to the axis of the polarizer. The expression,
known as Malus's law, applies to any two polarizing materials having
transmission axes at an angle to each other.
When an unpolarized light beam is reflected from a surface, the reflected
light is completely polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized, depending
on the angle of incidence. For angles of incidence between 0° and
90°, however, the reflected light is polarized to some extent. For one particular
angle, called the polarizing angle, of incidence the reflected beam is
completely polarized. An expression relating the polarizing angle with the
index of refraction of the reflecting surface is called Brewster's law.
When light is incident on a system of particles, such as a gas, the electrons
in the medium can absorb and reradiate part of the light. The absorption
and reradiation of light by the medium, called scattering, is what causes
sunlight reaching an observer on Earth from straight overhead to be polarized.
You can observe this effect by looking directly up through a pair
of sunglasses made of polarizing glass.
Optical Activity
Many important practical applications of polarized light involve the use
of certain materials that display the property of optical activity. A substance
is said to be optically active if it rotates the plane of polarization of
transmitted light. Optical activity occurs in a material because of an
asymmetry in the shape of its constituent molecules. For example, some
proteins are optically active because of their spiral shapes. Other materials,
such as glass and plastic, become optically active when placed under
stress.
An effect similar to rotation of the plane of polarization is used to create
the familiar displays on pocket calculators, wristwatches, notebook
computers, and so forth. The properties of a unique substance called a liquid
crystal make these displays (called LCD's, for liquid crystal displays)
possible. As its name implies, a liquid crystal is a substance with properties
intermediate between those of a crystalline solid and those of a liquid; that
137
is, the molecules of the substance are more orderly than those in a liquid,
but less orderly than those in a pure crystalline solid.

OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 25, answer
the questions after the texts
We use devices made from lenses, mirrors, or other optical components
every time we put on a pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses, take a photograph,
look at the sky through a telescope, and so on. In this Unit we examine
how these and other optical instruments work. For the most part, our
analyses will involve the laws of reflection and refraction and the procedures
of geometric optics. To explain certain phenomena, however, we
must use the wave nature of light.
The camera
The single-lens photographic camera is a simple optical instrument. It
consists of an opaque box, a converging lens that produces a real image,
and a film behind the lens to receive the image. Focusing is accomplished
by varying the distance between lens and film - with an adjustable bellows
in antique cameras and with some other mechanical arrangements in contemporary
models. For proper focusing, which leads to sharp images, the
lens-to-film distance depends on the object distance as well as on the
focal length of the lens. The shutter, located behind the lens, is a mechanical
device that is opened for selected time intervals. With this arrangement,
moving objects can be photographed by using short exposure
times, dark scenes (with low light levels) by using long exposure times. If
this adjustment were not available, it would be impossible to take stop139
action photographs. A rapidly moving vehicle, for example, could move
far enough while the shutter was open to produce a blurred image. Another
major cause of blurred images is movement of the camera while the
shutter is open. To prevent such movement, you should mount the camera
on a tripod or use short exposure times.
Most cameras also have an aperture of adjustable diameter to further
control the intensity of the light reaching the film. When an aperture of
small diameter is used, only light from the central portion of the lens
reaches the film, so spherical aberration is reduced. The brightness of the
image formed on the film depends on the light intensity, so we see that it
ultimately depends on both the focal length and diameter of the lens. The
ratio the focal length and diameter is called the focal ratio of a lens.
The eye
Like a camera, a normal eye focuses light and produces a sharp image.
However, the mechanisms by which the eye controls the amount of light
admitted and adjusts to produce correctly focused images are far more
complex, intricate, and effective than those in even the most sophisticated
camera. In all respects, the eye is a physiological wonder. The eye focuses
on an object by varying the shape of the pliable crystalline lens through
an amazing process called accommodation.
When the eye suffers a mismatch between the focusing power of the
lens-cornea system and the length of the eye so that light rays reach the
retina before they converge to form an image, the condition is known as
farsightedness (or hyperopia). A farsighted person can usually see faraway
objects clearly but not nearby objects. The condition can be corrected by
placing a converging lens in front of the eye.
Nearsightedness (or myopia) is another mismatch condition in which a
person is able to focus on nearby objects, but not faraway objects. Nearsightedness
can be corrected with a diverging lens. The lens refracts the
rays away from the principal axis before they enter the eye, allowing them
to focus on the retina.
In the eye defect known as astigmatism, light from a point source produces
a line image on the retina. This condition arises when either the cornea
or the lens (or both) are not perfectly symmetric. Astigmatism can be
corrected with lenses having different curvatures in two mutually perpendicular
directions.
Optometrists and ophthalmologists usually prescribe lenses measured
in diopters.

The simple magnifier
The simple magnifier is one of the most basic of all optical instruments
because it consists only of a single converging lens. As the name implies,
this device is used to increase the apparent size of an object. Clearly, the
size of the image formed at the retina depends on the angle subtended by
the object at the eye. As the object moves closer to the eye, angle increases
and a larger image is observed. The lens allows the object to be
viewed closer to the eye than is possible without the lens.
The compound microscope
Greater magnification can be achieved by combining two lenses in a
device called a compound microscope. The instrument consists of two
lenses: an objective with a very short focal length (< 1 cm), and an ocular
lens, or eyepiece, with a focal length of a few centimeters. The basic
approach used to analyze the image formation properties of a microscope
is that of two lenses in a row: the image formed by the first becomes the
object for the second.
The microscope has extended our vision into the previously unknown
realm of incredibly small objects, and the capabilities of this instrument
have increased steadily with improved techniques in precision grinding of
lenses. A natural question is whether there is any limit to how powerful a
microscope could be. For example, could a microscope be made powerful
enough to allow us to see an atom? The answer to this question is no, as
long as visible light is used to illuminate the object. In order to be seen,
the object under a microscope must be at least as large as a wavelength of
light. An atom is many times smaller than the wavelength of visible light,
so its mysteries must be probed via other techniques.
The telescope
There are two fundamentally different types of telescope, both designed
to help us view distant objects such as the planets in our Solar System.
These two types are (1) the refracting telescope, which uses a combination
of lenses to form an image, and (2) the reflecting telescope, which uses a
curved mirror and a lens to form an image. Once again, we will be able to
analyze the telescope by considering it to be a system of two optical elements
in a row. As before, the basic technique followed is that the image
formed by the first element becomes the object for the second.
The largest optical telescopes in the world are the two 10-m-diameter
Keck reflectors on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The largest single-mirrored reflecting
telescope in the United States is the 5-m-diameter instrument on
142
Mount Palomar in California. In contrast, the largest refracting telescope in
the world, at the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, has a diameter
of only 1 m.
The Michelson interferometer
The Michelson interferometer is an optical instrument having great
scientific importance. Invented by the American physicist A. A. Michelson
(1852-1931), it is an ingenious device that splits a light beam into
two parts and then recombines them to form an interference pattern.
The interferometer is used to make accurate length measurements.

RELATIVITY
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 26, answer
the questions after the texts
Most of our everyday experiences and observations have to do with
objects that move at speeds much less than the speed of light. Newtonian
mechanics was formulated to describe the motion of such objects, and its
formalism is quite successful in describing a wide range of phenomena
that occur at low speeds. It fails, however, when applied to particles
having speeds approaching that of light.
This Unit introduces Einstein's theory of special relativity and includes a
section on general relativity. The concepts of special relativity often violate
our common sense. Moving clocks run slow, and the length of a
moving meter stick is contracted. Nonetheless, the theory has been rigorously
tested, correctly predicting the results of experiments involving
speeds near the speed of light. The theory is verified daily in particle accelerators
around the world.
Experiments show that the speed of the electron - as well as the speed
of any other particle that has mass - always remains less than the speed of
light, regardless of the size of the accelerating voltage. The existence of a
universal speed limit has far-reaching consequences. It means that the
usual concepts of force, momentum, and energy no longer apply for
rapidly moving objects. Less obvious consequences include the fact
that observers moving at different speeds will measure different time intervals
and displacements between the same two events. Newtonian mechanics
was contradicted by experimental observations, so it was necessary
to replace it with another theory.
In 1905, at the age of 26, Einstein published his special theory of relativity.
Regarding the theory, Einstein wrote: The relativity theory arose
from necessity, from serious and deep contradictions in the old theory
from which there seemed no escape. The strength of the new theory
145
lies in the consistency and simplicity with which it solves all these difficulties,
using only a few very convincing assumptions.
The principle of Galilean relativity
In order to describe a physical event, it's necessary to choose a frame of
reference. For example, when you perform an experiment in a laboratory,
you select a coordinate system, or frame of reference, that is at rest with
respect to the laboratory. However, suppose an observer in a passing car
moving at a constant velocity with respect to the lab were to observe your
experiment. Would the observations made by the moving observer differ
dramatically from yours? That is, if you found Newton's first law to be
valid in your frame of reference, would the moving observer agree with
you? According to the principle of Galilean relativity, the laws of mechanics
must be the same in all inertial frames of reference.
Speed of light
It's natural to ask whether the concept of Galilean relativity in mechanics
also applies to experiments in electricity, magnetism, optics, and other
areas. Experiments indicate the answer is no. For example, if we assume
that the laws of electricity and magnetism are the same in all inertial
frames, a paradox concerning the speed of light immediately arises. In
order to resolve this paradox, we must conclude that either (1) the addition
law for velocities is incorrect or (2) the laws of electricity and magnetism
are not the same in all inertial frames.
In the 19th century, physicists thought that electromagnetic waves also
required a medium in order to propagate. They proposed that such a
medium existed and gave it the name luminiferous ether. The ether was
assumed to be present everywhere, even in empty space, and light waves
were viewed as ether oscillations.
The second hypothesis is false - and we now believe that the laws of
electricity and magnetism are the same in all inertial frames.
The Michelson-Morley experiment
The most famous experiment designed to detect small changes in
the speed of light was first performed in 1881 by Albert A. Michelson
(1852-1931) and later repeated under various conditions by Michelson
and Edward W. Morley (1838-1923). We state at the outset that the
outcome of the experiment contradicted the ether hypothesis. The experiment
was designed to determine the velocity of Earth relative to the
hypothetical ether. The experimental tool used was the Michelson interferometer.
The Michelson-Morley experiment was repeated at different
146
times of the year when the ether wind was expected to change direction,
but the results were always the same: no fringe shift of the magnitude required
was ever observed.

In later years, when more was known about the nature of light, the
idea of an ether that permeates all of space was relegated to the theoretical
graveyard. Light is now understood to be an electromagnetic wave,
which requires no medium for its propagation. As a result, the idea of an ether
in which these waves could travel became unnecessary.
Einstein's principle of relativity
In 1905 Albert Einstein proposed a theory that resolved this contradiction
but at the same time completely altered our notions of space and
time. He based his special theory of relativity on two postulates. The first
postulate asserts that all the laws of physics are the same in all reference
frames moving with constant velocity relative to each other. This postulate
is a sweeping generalization of the principle of Galilean relativity,
which refers only to the laws of mechanics. From an experimental point of
view, Einstein's principle of relativity means that any kind of experiment -
mechanical, thermal, optical, or electrical - performed in a laboratory at
rest, must give the same result when performed in a laboratory moving at
a constant speed past the first one. The postulate 2 asserts that the speed
of light in a vacuum has the same value in all inertial reference frames,
regardless of the velocity of the observer or the velocity of the source
emitting the light.
If we accept Einstein's theory of relativity, we must conclude that uniform
relative motion is unimportant when measuring the speed of light.
At the same time, we have to adjust our commonsense notions of space
and time and be prepared for some rather bizarre consequences. In relativistic
mechanics, there is no such thing as absolute length or absolute time.
Further, events at different locations that are observed to occur simultaneously
in one frame are not observed to be simultaneous in another frame moving
uniformly past the first. The principle of relativity states that there is no preferred
inertial frame of reference.
Properly describing the motion of particles within the framework of
special relativity requires generalizing Newton's laws of motion and the
definitions of momentum and energy. These generalized definitions reduce
to the classical (nonrelativistic) definitions when velocity (v) is much
less than speed of light (c). The relativistic equation for momentum reduces
to the classical expression when v is small compared with с.
The definition of momentum required generalization to make it
compatible with the principle of relativity. Likewise, the definition of
kinetic energy requires modification in relativistic mechanics. Einstein
148
found the correct expression for the kinetic energy of an object shows
the amazing result that a stationary particle with zero kinetic energy has an
energy proportional to its mass.
Pair production and annihilation
In general, converting mass into energy is a low-yield process. Burning
wood or coal, or even the fission or fusion processes convert only a
very small percentage of the available energy. An exception is the reaction
of matter with antimatter. A common process in which a photon creates
matter is called pair production. In this process, an electron and a
positron are simultaneously produced, while the photon disappears. In
order for pair production to occur, energy, momentum, and charge
must all be conserved during the process. It's impossible for a photon to
produce a single electron because the photon has zero charge and charge
would not be conserved in the process. Pair annihilation is a process in
which an electron-positron pair produces two photons-the inverse of pair
production. Momentum can be conserved only if two photons moving in
opposite directions, both with the same energy and magnitude of momentum,
are produced.
General relativity
Special relativity relates observations of inertial observers. Einstein
sought a more general theory that would address accelerating systems. His
search was motivated in part by the following curious fact: mass determines
the inertia of an object and also the strength of the gravitational
field. Einstein's remarkable theory of gravitation is known as general relativity,
in 1916.
One interesting effect predicted by general relativity is that time scales
are altered by gravity. A clock in the presence of gravity runs more slowly
than one in which gravity is negligible. As a consequence, light emitted from
atoms in a strong gravity field, such as the Sun's, is observed to have a
lower frequency than the same light emitted by atoms in the laboratory.
This gravitational shift has been detected in spectral lines emitted by atoms
in massive stars. It has also been verified on Earth by comparing the frequencies
of gamma rays emitted from nuclei separated vertically by about
20 m.
General relativity also predicts extreme states of matter created by
gravitational collapse. If the concentration of mass becomes very great, as
is believed to occur when a large star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses
to a very small volume, a black hole may form. Here the curvature
149
of space-time is so extreme that all matter and light within a certain radius
becomes trapped. There is strong evidence for the existence of a black
hole having a mass of millions of Suns at the center of our galaxy.

QUANTUM PHYSICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 27, answer
the questions after the texts
Although many problems were resolved by the theory of relativity in
the early part of the 20th century, many other problems remained unsolved.
Attempts to explain the behavior of matter on the atomic level with
the laws of classical physics were consistently unsuccessful. Various phenomena,
such as the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a heated object
(blackbody radiation), the emission of electrons by illuminated metals (the
photoelectric effect), and the emission of sharp spectral lines by gas atoms
in an electric discharge tube, couldn't be understood within the framework
of classical physics. Between 1900 and 1930, however, a modern version of
mechanics called quantum mechanics or wave mechanics was highly successful
in explaining the behavior of atoms, molecules, and nuclei.
The earliest ideas of quantum theory were introduced by Planck, and
most of the subsequent mathematical developments, interpretations, and
improvements were made by a number of distinguished physicists, including
Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, de Broglie, Heisenberg, I Born, and Dirac.
In this Unit we introduce the underlying ideas of quantum theory and the
wave-particle nature of matter, and discuss some simple applications of
quantum theory, including the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect,
and x-rays.
151
Blackbody radiation and Planck's hypothesis
An object at any temperature emits electromagnetic radiation, called
thermal radiation. The spectrum of the radiation depends on the temperature
and properties of the object. At low temperatures, the wavelengths
of the thermal radiation are mainly in the infrared region and
hence not observable by the eye. As the temperature of an object increases,
the object eventually begins to glow red. At sufficiently high temperatures,
it appears to be white, as in the glow of the hot tungsten filament of
a light-bulb. A careful study of thermal radiation shows that it consists of
a continuous distribution of wavelengths from the infrared, visible, and
ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.
By the end of the 19th century, it had become apparent that the classical
theory of thermal radiation was inadequate. The basic problem was
in understanding the observed distribution energy as a function of wavelength
in the radiation emitted by a blackbody. By definition, a blackbody
is an ideal system that absorbs all radiation incident on it. The radiated
energy varies with wavelength and temperature. As the temperature
of the blackbody increases, the total amount of energy it emits increases.
Also, with increasing temperature, the peak of the distribution
shifts to shorter wavelengths. This shift obeys called Wien's displacement
law. At long wavelengths, classical theory is in good agreement with the
experimental data. At short wavelengths, however, major disagreement
exists between classical theory and experiment. In fact, the theory erroneously
predicts that the intensity should be infinite, when the experimental
data shows it should approach zero. This contradiction is called
the ultraviolet catastrophe, because theory and experiment disagree
strongly in the short-wavelength, ultraviolet region of the spectrum.
In 1900 Planck developed a formula for blackbody radiation
that was in complete agreement with experiments at all wavelengths.
Planck hypothesized that blackbody radiation was produced by
submicroscopic charged oscillators, which he called resonators. He
assumed that the walls of a glowing cavity were composed of billions
of these resonators, although their exact nature was unknown.
Because the energy of each resonator can have only discrete values, we
say the energy is quantized.
The key point in Planck's theory is the assumption of quantized energy
states. This is a radical departure from classical physics, the "quantum
leap" that led to a totally new understanding of nature. It's shocking: it's
152
like saying a pitched baseball can have only a fixed number of different
speeds, and no speeds in between those fixed values. When Planck presented
his theory, most scientists (including Planck!) didn't consider the
quantum concept to be realistic; however, subsequent developments
showed that a theory based on the quantum concept (rather than on
classical concepts) had to be used to explain a number of other phenomena
at the atomic level.
Photoelectric effect and the particle theory of light
In the latter part of the 19th century, experiments showed that light
incident on certain metallic surfaces caused the emission of electrons are
emitted from the surfaces. This phenomenon is known as the photoelectric
effect, and the emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. The first
discovery of this phenomenon was made by Hertz, who was also the first
to produce the electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell.
A successful explanation of the photoelectric effect was given by Einstein
in 1905, the same year he published his special theory of relativity.
As part of a general paper on electromagnetic radiation, for which he received
the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein extended Planck's concept of
quantization to electromagnetic waves. He suggested that a tiny packet of
light energy or photon would be emitted when a quantized oscillator made
a jump from an energy state to the next lower state. The work function,
which represents the minimum energy with which an electron is bound in
the metal, is on the order of a few electron volts.
X- rays
In 1895 at the University of Wurzburg, Wilhelm Roentgen (1845-1923)
was studying electrical discharges in low-pressure gases when he noticed
that a fluorescent screen glowed even when placed several meters from
the gas discharge tube and even when black cardboard was placed between
the tube and the screen. He concluded that the effect was caused by
a mysterious type of radiation, which he called x-rays because of their unknown
nature. Subsequent study showed that these rays traveled at or
near the speed of light and that they couldn't be deflected by either electric
or magnetic fields. This last fact indicated that x-rays did not consist
of beams of charged particles, although the possibility that they were
beams of uncharged particles remained.

In 1912 Max von Laue (1879-1960) suggested that if x-rays were
electromagnetic waves with very short wavelengths, it should be possible
to diffract them by using the regular atomic spacings of a crystal
lattice as a diffraction grating, just as visible light is diffracted by a ruled
grating. X-ray diffraction has proved to be an invaluable technique for
understanding the structure of matter. The continuous radiation is sometimes
called bremsstrahlung, a German word meaning "braking radiation,"
because electrons emit radiation when they undergo an acceleration inside
the target.
The Compton - effect
Further justification for the photon nature of light came from an
experiment conducted by Arthur H. Compton in 1923. In his experiment,
Compton directed an x-ray beam of wavelength toward a block of graphite.
He found that the scattered x-rays had a slightly longer wavelength than the
incident x-rays, and hence the energies of the scattered rays were lower.
The amount of energy reduction depended on the angle at which the xrays
were scattered. The change in wavelength between a scattered x-ray
and an incident x-ray is called the Compton shift.
The dual nature of light and matter
Phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and the Compton effect
offer evidence that when light (or other forms of electromagnetic radiation)
and matter interact, the light behaves as if it were composed of particles
having energy and momentum. In other contexts, however, light acts
like a wave, exhibiting interference and diffraction effects. Light has a
dual nature, exhibiting both wave and particle characteristics.
According to de Broglie, electrons, just like light, have a dual particlewave
nature. De Broglie suggested that all material particles with momentum
p should have a characteristic wavelength. Further, de Broglie postulated
that the frequencies of matter waves (waves associated with particles
having nonzero rest energy) obey the Einstein relationship for photons.
In 1927, three years after de Broglie published his work, C. J. Davisson
(1881-1958) and L. H. Germer (1896-1971) of the United States succeeded
in measuring the wavelength of electrons. Their important discovery
provided the first experimental confirmation of the matter waves proposed
by de Broglie.
Wave function
In 1926, the Austrian-German physicist Erwin Schrodinger proposed
a wave equation that described how matter waves change in space and
155
time. The Schrodinger wave equation represents a key element in the
theory of quantum mechanics. It's as important in quantum mechanics
as Newton's laws in classical mechanics. Schrodinger's equation has
been successfully applied to the hydrogen atom and to many other microscopic
systems.
Uncertainty principle
In 1927, Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) introduced notion, which is
now known as the uncertainty principle. It is physically impossible to measure
simultaneously the exact position and exact linear momentum of a particle.
The scanning tunneling microscope
One of the basic phenomena of quantum mechanics - tunneling - is
at the heart of a very practical device - the scanning tunneling microscope,
or STM - which enables us to get highly detailed images of surfaces
with a resolution comparable to the size of a single atom. The STM
has, however, one serious limitation: it depends on electrical conductivity
of the sample and the tip. A newer microscope - the atomic force microscope,
or AFM - overcomes this limitation. It measures the force between
a tip and the sample, rather than an electrical current. The AFM
has comparable sensitivity for measuring topography and has become
widely used for technological applications.

play in the effect of a magnetic field on certain quantum states. The fact
that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers
- the Pauli exclusion principle - is extremely important in understanding
the properties of complex atoms and the arrangement of elements in
the periodic table. Finally, we apply our knowledge of atomic structure to
describe the mechanisms involved in the production of x-rays, the operation
of a laser, and the behavior of solid-state devices such as diodes and
transistors.
Early models of the atom
The model of the atom in the days of Newton was a tiny, hard, indestructible
sphere. Although this model was a good basis for the kinetic
theory of gases, new models had to be devised when later experiments
revealed the electronic nature of atoms. J. J. Thomson (1856-1940) suggested
a model of the atom as a volume of positive charge with electrons
embedded throughout the volume, much like the seeds in a watermelon.
In 1911 Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) and his students Hans Geiger
and Ernest Marsden performed a critical experiment showing that
Thomson's model couldn't be correct. In this experiment, a beam of positively
charged alpha particles was projected against a thin metal foil. The
results of the experiment were astounding. Most of the alpha particles
passed through the foil as if it were empty space, but a few particles deflected
from their original direction of travel were scattered through large
angles. Some particles were even deflected backwards, reversing their
direction of travel. When Geiger informed Rutherford of these results,
Rutherford wrote, "It was quite the most incredible event that has ever
happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-
inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."
Rutherford explained these astounding results by assuming that the
positive charge in an atom was concentrated in a region that was small
relative to the size of the atom. He called this concentration of positive
charge the nucleus of the atom. Alpha particles themselves were later
identified as the nuclei of helium atoms.
Atomic spectra
158
The hydrogen atom is the simplest atomic system and an especially
important one to understand. Much of what we know about the hydrogen
atom (which consists of one proton and one electron) can be extended
directly to other single-electron ions such as He+ and Li2+. Further, a
thorough understanding of the physics underlying the hydrogen atom
can then be used to describe more complex atoms and the periodic
table of the elements.
If a voltage applied between metal electrodes in the tube is great
enough to produce an electric current in the gas, the tube emits light
having a color that depends on the gas inside. (This is how a neon sign
works.). When the emitted light is analyzed with a spectrometer, discrete
bright lines are observed, each having a different wavelength, or color.
Such a series of spectral lines is commonly called an emission spectrum.
The wavelengths contained in such a spectrum are characteristic of the
element emitting the light. Because no two elements emit the same line
spectrum, this phenomenon represents a marvelous and reliable technique
for identifying elements in a gaseous substance.
In addition to emitting light at specific wavelengths, an element can
absorb light at specific wavelengths. The spectral lines corresponding to
this process form what is known as an absorption spectrum. The absorption
spectrum of an element has many practical applications. For example,
the continuous spectrum of radiation emitted by the Sun must
pass through the cooler gases of the solar atmosphere before reaching
the Earth. Because the Greek word for Sun is helios, the new element was
named helium.

The Bohr theory of hydrogen and its modification
At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists were perplexed by the
failure of classical physics to explain the characteristics of spectra. In 1913
Bohr provided an explanation of atomic spectra that includes some features
of the currently accepted theory. The equations of his theory is
based on the assumption that the electron can exist only in certain allowed
orbits determined by the integer n. The orbit with the smallest radius,
called the Bohr radius, corresponds to n = 1. The lowest energy
state, or ground state, corresponds to n = 1. The minimum energy required
to ionize the atom - that is, to completely remove the electron - is
called the ionization energy.
Newtonian mechanics cannot be used to describe phenomena that
occur at speeds approaching the speed of light. Newtonian mechanics is
a special case of relativistic mechanics and applies only when v is much
smaller than с. Similarly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with classical
physics when the energy differences between quantized levels are very
small. This principle, first set forth by Bohr, is called the correspondence
principle.
Within a few months following the publication of Bohr's paper, Arnold
Sommerfeld (1868-1951) extended the Bohr model to include elliptical
orbits. Bohr's concept of quantization of angular momentum led to the principal
quantum number n, which determines the energy of the allowed states
of hydrogen. Sommerfeld's theory retained n, but also introduced a new
quantum number, called the orbital quantum number. Another modification
of the Bohr theory arose when it was discovered that the spectral lines of a
gas are split into several closely spaced lines when the gas is placed in a
strong magnetic field. This is called the Zeeman effect, after its discoverer. In
order to explain this observation, a new quantum number called the orbital
magnetic quantum number.
Finally, very high resolution spectrometers revealed that spectral lines
of gases are in fact two very closely spaced lines even in the absence of an
external magnetic field. This splitting was referred to as fine structure. In
1925 Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck introduced the idea of an
electron spinning about its own axis to explain the origin of fine structure.
The results of their work introduced yet another quantum number, called
the spin magnetic quantum number.
For more than a decade following Bohr's publication, no one was able to
explain why the angular momentum of the electron was restricted to discrete
161
values. Finally, de Broglie gave a direct physical way of interpreting this
condition. He assumed that an electron orbit would be stable (allowed) only
if it contained an integral number of electron wavelengths. Although the
analysis provided by de Broglie was a promising first step, gigantic
strides were made subsequently with the development of Schrodinger's
wave equation and its application to atomic systems.
Quantum mechanics predicts that the wave function for the hydrogen
atom in the ground state is spherically symmetric; hence the electron can
be found in a spherical region surrounding the nucleus. This is in contrast
to the Bohr theory, which confines the position of the electron to
points in a plane. The quantum mechanical result is often interpreted by
viewing the electron as a cloud surrounding the nucleus.
The exclusion principle
How many electrons in an atom can have a particular set of quantum
numbers? This important question was answered by Pauli in 1925 in a
powerful statement known as the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons
in an atom can ever have the same set of values for the set of quantum numbers.
The Pauli exclusion principle explains the electronic structure of
complex atoms as a succession of filled levels with different quantum
numbers increasing in energy, where the outermost electrons are primarily
responsible for the chemical properties of the element. If this principle
weren't valid, every electron would end up in the lowest energy state
of the atom and the chemical behavior of the elements would be grossly
different.
Atomic transitions
An atom will emit radiation only at certain frequencies that correspond
to the energy separation between the various allowed states. At
ordinary temperatures, most of the atoms in a sample are in the ground
state. If a vessel containing many atoms of a gas is illuminated with a
light beam containing all possible photon frequencies (that is, a continuous
spectrum), only those photons of energies, and so on, can be absorbed.
As a result of this absorption, some atoms are raised to various
allowed higher energy levels, called excited states.
An incident photon can cause atomic transitions either upward (stimulated
absorption) or downward (stimulated emission). The two processes
are equally probable. When light is incident on a system of atoms,
there is usually a net absorption of energy, because when the system is in
thermal equilibrium, there are many more atoms in the ground state
162
than in excited states. However, if the situation can be inverted so that
there are more atoms in an excited state than in the ground state, a net
emission of photons can result. Such a condition is called population
inversion. This is the fundamental principle involved in the operation of
a laser. One interesting application of the laser is holography: the production
of three-dimensional images of objects.
Energy bands in solids
In solids, the discrete levels of isolated atoms broaden into allowed
energy bands separated by forbidden gaps. The separation and electron
population of the highest bands determines whether a given solid
is a conductor, an insulator, or a semiconductor. An electron can have
any energy within an allowed energy band, but cannot have an energy in
the band gap, or the region between allowed bands. The highest filled
band is called the valence band and the next higher empty band is called
the conduction band. In quantum terms, electron energies increase if there
are higher unoccupied energy levels for electrons to jump to.
A conductor has a highest-energy occupied band which is partially
filled, and in an insulator, has a highest-energy occupied band which is
completely filled with a large energy gap between the valence and conduction
bands. Semiconductor is a material with a small band gap of about
1eV whose conductivity results from appreciable thermal excitation of
electrons across the gap into the conduction band at room temperature.
The process of adding impurities, called doping, is important in making
devices having well-defined regions of different resistivity.
The invention of the transistor by John Bardeen (1908-1991), Walter
Brattain (1902-1987), and William Shockley (1910-1989) in 1948 totally
revolutionized the world of electronics. For this work, these three
men shared a Nobel prize in 1956. By 1960, the transistor had replaced
the vacuum tube in many electronic applications. One simple form of the
transistor, called the junction transistor, consists of a semiconducting material
in which a very narrow n region is sandwiched between two p regions.
This configuration is called a pnp transistor. Another configuration
is the npn transistor. The outer regions are called the emitter and collector,
and the narrow central region is called the base.
Invented independently by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in late
1958 and by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Camera and Instrument in early
1959, the integrated circuit has been justly called "the most remarkable
technology ever to hit mankind." In simplest terms, an integrated circuit is

NUCLEAR PHYSICS
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 29, answer
the questions after the texts
In 1896, the year that marks the birth of nuclear physics, Henri Becquerel
(1852-1908) discovered radioactivity in uranium compounds. A
great deal of activity followed this discovery as researchers attempted to
understand and characterize the radiation that we now know to be emitted
by radioactive nuclei. Pioneering work by Rutherford showed that the
radiation was of three types, which he called alpha, beta, and gamma rays.
These types are classified according to the nature of their electric charge
and their ability to penetrate matter. Later experiments showed that alpha
rays are helium nuclei, beta rays are electrons, and gamma rays are highenergy
photons.
In 1911 Rutherford and his students Geiger and Marsden performed a
number of important scattering experiments involving alpha particles.
These experiments established the idea that the nucleus of an atom can be
regarded as essentially a point mass and point charge and that most of the
atomic mass is contained in the nucleus. Further, such studies demonstrated
a wholly new type of force: the nuclear force, which is predominant at
distances of less than about 10~14 m and drops quickly to zero at greater
distances.
165
Other milestones in the development of nuclear physics include:
- the first observations of nuclear reactions by Rutherford and
coworkers in 1919, in which naturally occurring α particles bombarded
nitrogen nuclei to produce oxygen,
- the first use of artificially accelerated protons to produce nuclear reactions,
by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932,
- the discovery of the neutron by Chadwick in 1932,
- the discovery of artificial radioactivity by Joliot and Irene Curie in
1933,
- the discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn, Strassman, Meitner, and
Frisch in 1938,
- the development of the first controlled fission reactor by Fermi
and his collaborators in 1942.
Some properties of nuclei
All nuclei are composed of two types of particles: protons and neutrons.
The only exception is the ordinary hydrogen nucleus, which is a
single proton. In describing some of the properties of nuclei, such as
their charge, mass, and radius, we make use of the following quantities:
- the atomic number Z, which equals the number of protons in the nucleus,
- the neutron number N, which equals the number of neutrons in the
nucleus,
- the mass number A, which equals the number of nucleons in the
nucleus (nucleon is a generic term used to refer to either a proton or a
neutron).
The nuclei of all atoms of a particular element must contain the same
number of protons, but they may contain different numbers of neutrons.
Nuclei that are related in this way are called isotopes. The isotopes of an
element have the same Z value, but different N and A values.
The size and structure of nuclei were first investigated in the scattering
experiments of Rutherford. Using the principle of conservation of
energy, Rutherford found an expression for how close an alpha particle
moving directly toward the nucleus can come to the nucleus before being
turned around by Coulomb repulsion. Rutherford concluded that the
positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a small sphere, which he
called the nucleus, with radius no greater than about 10-14m. Because
such small lengths are common in nuclear physics, a convenient unit of
length is the femtometer (fm), sometimes called the fermi.
166
The total mass of a nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses
of its nucleons. Also, because mass is another manifestation of energy, the
total energy of the bound system (the nucleus) is less than the combined
energy of the separated nucleons. This difference in energy is called the
binding energy of the nucleus and can be thought of as the energy that
must be added to a nucleus to break it apart into its separated neutrons
and protons.
Radioactivity
In 1896, Becquerel accidentally discovered that uranium salt crystals
emit an invisible radiation that can darken a photographic plate even if
the plate is covered to exclude light. After several such observations under
controlled conditions, he concluded that the radiation emitted by the
crystals was of a new type, one requiring no external stimulation. This
spontaneous emission of radiation was soon called radioactivity. Subsequent
experiments by other scientists showed that other substances were
also radioactive.
Three types of radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance:
alpha (α) particles, in which the emitted particles are He nuclei; beta (β)
particles, in which the emitted particles are either electrons or positrons;
and gamma (γ) rays, in which the emitted "rays" are high-energy
photons. A positron is a particle similar to the electron in all respects,
except that it has a charge of + e. (The positron is said to be the antiparticle
of the electron.)
The decay rate, or activity R, of a sample is defined as the number of
decays per second. Another parameter that is useful for characterizing
radioactive decay is the half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance
is the time it takes for half of a given number of radioactive nuclei
to decay. The unit of activity R is the curie (Ci). The SI unit of activity is
the becquerel (Bq): 1 Bq = 1 decay/s.
Radioactive nuclei decay spontaneously via alpha, beta, and gamma
decay. If a nucleus emits an alpha particle (2He), it loses two protons and
two neutrons. In order for alpha emission to occur, the mass of the
parent must be greater than the combined mass of the daughter
and the alpha particle. In the decay process, this excess mass is
converted into energy of other forms and appears in the form of kinetic
energy in the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle.

When a radioactive nucleus undergoes beta decay, the daughter nucleus
has the same number of nucleons as the parent nucleus, but the atomic
number is changed by 1. In 1930 Pauli proposed that a third particle must
be present to carry away the "missing" energy and to conserve momentum.
Later, Enrico Fermi developed a complete theory of beta decay and
named this particle the neutrino ("little neutral one") because it had to be
electrically neutral and have little or no mass. In beta decay, an electron
and an anti-neutrino are emitted or a positron and a neutrino are emitted.
Very often a nucleus that undergoes radioactive decay is left in an excited
energy state. The nucleus can then undergo a second decay to a
lower energy state - perhaps even to the ground state - by emitting one or
more high-energy photons. The process is similar to the emission of light
by an atom. An atom emits radiation to release some extra energy when an
electron "jumps" from a state of high energy to a state of lower energy.
The photons emitted in the process are called gamma rays, which have
very high energy relative to the energy of visible light.
Natural radioactivity
Radioactive nuclei are generally classified into two groups: (1) unstable
nuclei found in nature, which give rise to what is called natural
radioactivity, and (2) nuclei produced in the laboratory through nuclear
reactions, which exhibit artificial radioactivity.
Nuclear reactions
It is possible to change the structure of nuclei by bombarding them
with energetic particles. Such changes are called nuclear reactions. Since
the time of Rutherford, thousands of nuclear reactions have been observed,
particularly following the development of charged-particle accelerators
in the 1930s. These high-energy particles are used to create new
particles whose properties are helping to solve the mysteries of the nucleus
(and indeed, of the Universe itself).
Nuclear reactions in which there is a release of energy - that is, positive
Q values - are said to be exothermic reactions. Reactions with negative Q
values are called endothermic reactions. It can be shown that in order to
conserve both energy and momentum, the incoming particle must have a
minimum kinetic energy. This minimum value of the kinetic energy of
the incoming particle is called the threshold energy.
Medical applications of radiation
Radiation absorbed by matter can cause severe damage. The degree
and kind of damage depend on several factors, including the type and
169
energy of the radiation and the properties of the absorbing material. Radiation
damage in biological organisms is due primarily to ionization
effects in cells. The normal function of a cell may be disrupted when
highly reactive ions or radicals are formed as the result of ionizing radiation.
Also, cells that do survive the radiation may become defective,
which can lead to cancer.
Several units are used to quantify radiation exposure and dose. The
roentgen (R) is defined as that amount of ionizing radiation which
will produce 2.08 x 109 ion pairs in 1 cm3 of air under standard conditions.
Radioactive particles can be used to trace chemicals participating in
various reactions.
One of the most valuable uses of radioactive tracers is in medicine.
Most medical applications of radiation require instruments to make
quantitative measurements of radioactive intensity. Various devices have
been developed to detect the energetic particles emitted when a radioactive
nucleus decays: the Geiger counter; a semiconductor diode detector;
a scintillation counter; Track detectors; a cloud chamber.

NUCLEAR ENERGY AND ELEMENTARY PARTICLES
Read the following texts. Study the thesaurus on fig. 30, answer
the questions after the texts
In this concluding Unit we discuss the two means by which energy can
be derived from nuclear reactions: fission, in which a nucleus of large
mass number splits into two smaller nuclei, and fusion, in which two
light nuclei fuse to form a heavier nucleus. In either case, there is a release
of large amounts of energy, which can be used destructively through
bombs or constructively through the production of electric power. We end
our study of physics by examining the known subatomic particles and the
171
fundamental interactions that govern their behavior. We also discuss the
current theory of elementary particles, which states that all matter in nature
is constructed from only two families of particles: quarks and leptons. Finally,
we describe how such models help us understand the evolution of
the Universe.
Nuclear fission
Nuclear fission occurs when a heavy nucleus, such as 235U, splits, or
fissions, into two smaller nuclei. In such a reaction, the total mass of the
products is less than the original mass of the heavy nucleus.
Nuclear fission was first observed in 1939 by Otto Hahn and Fritz
Strassman, following some basic studies by Fermi. After bombarding uranium
(Z = 92) with neutrons, Hahn and Strassman discovered two medium-
mass elements, barium and lanthanum, among the reaction products.
Shortly thereafter, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch explained what
had happened: the uranium nucleus had split into two nearly equal fragments
after absorbing a neutron. This was of considerable interest to
physicists attempting to understand the nucleus, but it was to have even
more far-reaching consequences. Measurements showed that about 200
MeV of energy is released in each fission event, and this fact was to
affect the course of human history.
Nuclear reactors
Neutrons are emitted when 235U undergoes fission. These neutrons can
in turn trigger other nuclei to undergo fission, with the possibility of a
chain reaction. Calculations show that if the chain reaction isn't controlled,
it will proceed too rapidly and possibly result in the sudden release
of an enormous amount of energy (an explosion), even from only 1g
of 235U. An uncontrolled fission reaction, of course, is the principle behind
the first nuclear bomb.
A nuclear reactor is a system designed to maintain what is called a
self-sustained chain reaction. This important process was first achieved in
1942 by a group led by Fermi at the University of Chicago, with natural
uranium as the fuel. Most reactors in operation today also use uranium
as fuel. Natural uranium contains only about 0.7% of the 235U isotope,
with the remaining 99.3% being the 238U isotope. This is important to the
operation of a reactor because 238U almost never undergoes fission. Instead,
it tends to absorb neutrons, producing neptunium and plutonium.
For this reason, reactor fuels must be artificially enriched so that they
contain several percent of the 235U isotope.
172
A useful parameter for describing the level of reactor operation is the
reproduction constant K, defined as the average number of neutrons
from each fission event that will cause another event. A self-sustained
chain reaction is achieved when K= 1. Under this condition, the reactor
is said to be critical. When К is less than one, the reactor is subcritical
and the reaction dies out. When К is greater than one the reactor is said
to be supercritical, and a runaway reaction occurs.
In any reactor, a fraction of the neutrons produced in fission will leak
out of the core before inducing other fission events (neutron leakage). If
the fraction leaking out is too large, the reactor will not operate.
The neutrons released in fission events are highly energetic, with kinetic
energies of about 2 MeV. It is found that slow neutrons are far more
likely than fast neutrons to produce fission events in 235U. Further, 238U
doesn't absorb slow neutrons. In order for the chain reaction to continue,
therefore, the neutrons must be slowed down. This is accomplished by surrounding
the fuel with a substance called a moderator.
In the process of being slowed down, neutrons may be captured by nuclei
that do not undergo fission. The most common event of this type is
neutron capture by 238U. The probability of neutron capture by 238U is very
high when the neutrons have high kinetic energies and very low when they
have low kinetic energies.
Nuclear fusion
The binding energy of light nuclei (those having a mass number lower
than 20) is much smaller than the binding energy of heavier nuclei. This
suggests a process that is the reverse of fission. When two light nuclei combine
to form a heavier nucleus, the process is called nuclear fusion. Because
the mass of the final nucleus is less than the masses of the original nuclei,
there is a loss of mass, accompanied by a release of energy. Although fusion
power plants have not yet been developed, a worldwide effort is under
way to harness the energy from fusion reactions in the laboratory.
All stars generate their energy through fusion processes. Stars are born
in regions of space containing vast clouds of dust and gas. Two conditions
must be met before fusion reactions in the star can sustain its energy
needs: (1) The temperature must be high enough (about 107 К for hydrogen)
to allow the kinetic energy of the positively charged hydrogen nuclei
to overcome their mutual Coulomb repulsion as they collide, and (2) the
density of nuclei must be high enough to ensure a high rate of collision.
One of the major problems in obtaining energy from nuclear fusion
is the fact that the Coulomb repulsion force between two charged nuclei
173
must be overcome before they can fuse. The fundamental challenge is to
give the two nuclei enough kinetic energy to overcome this repulsive
force. This can be accomplished by heating the fuel to extremely high
temperatures (about 108 K, far greater than the interior temperature of
the Sun). In addition to the high temperature requirements, there are two
other critical factors that determine whether or not a thermonuclear reactor
will function: the plasma ion density n and the plasma confinement time t -
the time the interacting ions are maintained at a temperature equal to or
greater than that required for the reaction to proceed. The density and
confinement time must both be large enough to ensure that more fusion
energy will be released than is required to heat the plasma.
Most fusion experiments use magnetic field confinement to contain a
plasma. One device, called a tokamak, has a doughnut-shaped geometry
(a toroid). This device, first developed in the former Soviet Union, uses a
combination of two magnetic fields to confine the plasma inside the
doughnut. A strong magnetic field is produced by the current in the windings,
and a weaker magnetic field is produced by the current in the toroid.
Elementary particles
The word "atom" is from the Greek word "atomos", meaning "indivisible."
At one time, atoms were thought to be the indivisible constituents of
matter; that is, they were regarded as elementary particles. Discoveries in
the early part of the 20th century revealed that the atom is not elementary,
but has protons, neutrons, and electrons as its constituents. Until 1932,
physicists viewed these three constituent particles as elementary because,
with the exception of the free neutron, they are highly stable. The theory
soon fell apart, however, and beginning in 1937, many new particles were
discovered in experiments involving high-energy collisions between
known particles. These new particles are characteristically unstable and
have very short half-lives, ranging between 10~23 s and 10~6 s. So far more
than 300 of them have been cataloged.
In the last 30 years, physicists have made tremendous advances in our
knowledge of the structure of matter by recognizing that all particles (with
the exception of electrons, photons, and a few others) are made of smaller
particles called quarks. Protons and neutrons, for example, are not truly
elementary but are systems of tightly bound quarks.
In the 1920s, the theoretical physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac
(1902-1984) developed a version of quantum mechanics that incorporated
special relativity. Dirac's theory successfully explained the origin of the
electron's spin and its magnetic moment. The general and profound impli174
cation of Dirac's theory is that for every particle, there is an antiparticle
with the same mass as the particle, but the opposite charge.
The positron was discovered by Carl Anderson in 1932, and in 1936 he
was awarded the Nobel prize for his achievement. Anderson discovered
the positron while examining tracks created by electron-like particles of
positive charge in a cloud chamber.
Practically every known elementary particle has a distinct antiparticle.
Among the exceptions are the photon and the neutral pion, which are
their own antiparticles. An antiparticle is not identified solely on the basis
of opposite charge: even neutral particles have antiparticles.
The beginning of particle physics
The first theory to explain the nature of the nuclear force was proposed
in 1935 by the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981), an
effort that later earned him the Nobel prize. In order to understand Yukawa's
theory, it is useful to first note that two atoms can form a covalent
chemical bond by the exchange of electrons. Similarly, in the modern
view of electromagnetic interactions, charged particles interact by exchanging
a photon.
The nuclear force was originally called the strong force. Once the
quark theory was established, however, the phrase strong force was
reserved for the force between quarks. We will follow this convention:
the strong force is between quarks and the nuclear force is between
nucleons.
In an effort to substantiate Yukawa's predictions, physicists began
looking for the meson by studying cosmic rays that enter the Earth's
atmosphere. In 1937, Carl Anderson and his collaborators discovered a
particle with mass 106 MeV/c2, about 207 times the mass of the electron.
However, subsequent experiments showed that the particle interacted
very weakly with matter and hence could not be the carrier of the
nuclear force. This puzzling situation inspired several theoreticians to propose
that there are two mesons with slightly different masses, an idea
that was confirmed in 1947 with the discovery of the pi meson (π), or
simply pion, by Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) and Guiseppe P. S.
Occhialini (1907-1993). The lighter meson discovered earlier by
Anderson, now called a muon, has only weak and electromagnetic
interactions and plays no role in the strong interaction.

All particles other than photons can be classified into two broad
categories, hadrons and leptons, according to their interactions. Particles
that interact through the strong force are called hadrons. There are two
classes of hadrons, known as mesons and baryons, distinguished by their
masses and spins. All mesons are known to decay finally into electrons,
positrons, neutrinos, and photons. Leptons (from the Greek leptos,
meaning "small" or "light") are a group of particles that participate in
the weak interaction. All leptons have a spin of 1/2. Included in this
group are electrons, muons, and neutrinos, which are less massive than
the lightest hadron.
Many particles discovered in the 1950s were produced by the nuclear
interaction of pions with protons and neutrons in the atmosphere. A
group of these particles was found to exhibit unusual properties in their
production and decay and hence were called strange particles. To explain
these unusual properties of strange particles, a law called conservation of
strangeness was introduced, together with a new quantum number S called
strangeness.
Scientists are convinced that because of the limited energy available in
conventional accelerators using fixed targets, it is necessary to build colliding-
beam accelerators called colliders. The concept of a collider is straightforward.
In such a device, particles with equal masses and kinetic energies,
traveling in opposite directions in an accelerator ring, collide head-on to
produce the required reaction and the formation of new particles.
Our understanding of physics at short and long distances is far from
complete. Particle physics is faced with many questions. The questions go
on and on. Because of the rapid advances and new discoveries in the related
fields of particle physics and cosmology, by the time you read this
book some of these questions may have been resolved and others may
have emerged.
1. What are the two ways of getting energy from nuclear reactions?
2. When does nuclear fission occur?
3. Why do reactor fuels must be artificially enriched?
4. What’s the main problem of getting energy from nuclear fusion?
5. Why did physicists regard protons, neutrons and electrons as elementary
particles before 1932?
6. What subatomic particles do you know?
7. What’s the concept of collider?
